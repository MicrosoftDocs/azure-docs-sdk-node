    summary: >-
      The blob prefix to use when downloading blobs from an Azure Storage
      container. Only the blobs

      whose names begin with the specified prefix will be downloaded. The
      property is valid only

      when autoStorageContainerName or storageContainerUrl is used. This prefix
      can be a partial

      filename or a subdirectory. If a prefix is not specified, all the files in
      the container will

      be downloaded.

    summary: >-
      The file permission mode attribute in octal format. This property applies
      only to files being

      downloaded to Linux compute nodes. It will be ignored if it is specified
      for a resourceFile

      which will be downloaded to a Windows node. If this property is not
      specified for a Linux

      node, then a default value of 0770 is applied to the file.

  - name: filePath
    uid: '@azure/arm-batch.ResourceFile.filePath'
    package: '@azure/arm-batch'
    summary: >-
      The location on the compute node to which to download the file, relative
      to the task's working

      directory. If the httpUrl property is specified, the filePath is required
      and describes the

      path which the file will be downloaded to, including the filename.
      Otherwise, if the

      autoStorageContainerName or storageContainerUrl property is specified,
      filePath is optional

      and is the directory to download the files to. In the case where filePath
      is used as a

      directory, any directory structure already associated with the input data
      will be retained in

      full and appended to the specified filePath directory. The specified
      relative path cannot

      break out of the task's working directory (for example by using '..').

  - name: httpUrl

    summary: >-
      The URL of the file to download. The autoStorageContainerName,
      storageContainerUrl and httpUrl

      properties are mutually exclusive and one of them must be specified. If
      the URL points to

      Azure Blob Storage, it must be readable from compute nodes. There are
      three ways to get such a

      URL for a blob in Azure storage: include a Shared Access Signature (SAS)
      granting read

      permissions on the blob, use a managed identity with read permission, or
      set the ACL for the

      blob or its container to allow public access.

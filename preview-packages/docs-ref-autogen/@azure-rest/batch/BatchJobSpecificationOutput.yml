      does specify a Job Manager Task, the Batch service creates the Job Manager
      Task when the Job is created, and will try to schedule the Job Manager
      Task before scheduling other Tasks in the Job.

      shutting down services that were started as part of Job preparation. A Job
      Release Task cannot be specified without also specifying a Job Preparation
      Task for the Job. The Batch service runs the Job Release Task on the

      The action the Batch service should take when all Tasks in a Job created
      under this schedule are in the completed state. Note that if a Job
      contains no Tasks, then all Tasks are considered complete. This option is
      therefore most commonly used with a Job Manager task; if you want to use
      automatic Job termination without a Job Manager, you should initially set
      onAllTasksComplete to noaction and update the Job properties to set
      onAllTasksComplete to terminatejob once you have finished adding Tasks.

      completes with a non-zero exit code after exhausting its retry count, or

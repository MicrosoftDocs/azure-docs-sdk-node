    summary: >-
      If this value is omitted or set to Hierarchical, VMs are grouped to
      reflect the zonal distribution in up to 15 UDs. Each of the three zones
      has five UDs. This ensures that the zones are updated one at a time,
      moving to next zone only after completing five UDs within the first zone.
      This update process is safer for the cluster and the user application.

    package: '@azure/arm-servicefabric'
    summary: >-
      VMs under the node type are grouped into UDs and ignore the zone info in
      five UDs. This setting causes UDs across all zones to be upgraded at the
      same time. This deployment mode is faster for upgrades, we don't recommend
      it because it goes against the SDP guidelines, which state that the
      updates should be applied to one zone at a time.

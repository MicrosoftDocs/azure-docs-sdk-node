    summary: >-
      Specifies the type of information to log for debugging. The permitted
      values are none, requestContent, responseContent, or both requestContent
      and responseContent separated by a comma. The default is none. When
      setting this value, carefully consider the type of information you are
      passing in during deployment. By logging information about the request or
      response, you could potentially expose sensitive data that is retrieved
      through the deployment operations.

      ### Known values supported by the service

      **vector**: Vector query where a raw vector value is provided.

      **text**: Vector query where a text value that needs to be vectorized is
      provided.

      **imageUrl**: Vector query where an url that represents an image value
      that needs to be vectorized is provided.

      **imageBinary**: Vector query where a base 64 encoded binary of an image
      that needs to be vectorized is provided.

      vector field.

    summary: >-
      Relative weight of the vector query when compared to other vector query
      and/or the text query within the same search request. This value is used
      when combining the results of multiple ranking lists produced by the
      different vector queries and/or the results retrieved through the text
      query. The higher the weight, the higher the documents that matched that
      query will be in the final ranking. Default is 1.0 and the value needs to
      be a positive number larger than zero.

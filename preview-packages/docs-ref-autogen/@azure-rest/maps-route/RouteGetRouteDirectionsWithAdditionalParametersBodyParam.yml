      Used for reconstructing a route and for calculating zero or more
      alternative routes to this reference route.  The provided sequence of
      coordinates is used as input for route reconstruction. The alternative
      routes  are calculated between the origin and destination points specified
      in the base path parameter locations.  If both minDeviationDistance and
      minDeviationTime are set to zero, then these origin and destination
      points  are expected to be at (or very near) the beginning and end of the
      reference route, respectively. Intermediate  locations (waypoints) are not
      supported when using supportingPoints.

      Setting at least one of minDeviationDistance or minDeviationTime to a
      value greater than zero has the  following consequences:


      *  The origin point of the calculateRoute request must be on (or very
      near) the input reference route. If  this is not the case, an error is
      returned. However, the origin point does not need to be at the beginning
      of  the input reference route (it can be thought of as the current vehicle
      position on the reference route).

      *  The reference route, returned as the first route in the calculateRoute
      response, will start at the origin  point specified in the calculateRoute
      request. The initial part of the input reference route up until the 
      origin point will be excluded from the response.

      *  The values of minDeviationDistance and minDeviationTime determine how
      far alternative routes will be  guaranteed to follow the reference route
      from the origin point onwards.

      *  The route must use departAt.

      *  The vehicleHeading is ignored.

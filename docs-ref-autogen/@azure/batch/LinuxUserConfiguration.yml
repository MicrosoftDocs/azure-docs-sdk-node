    summary: >-
      The SSH private key for the user Account. The private key must not be
      password protected. The

      private key is used to automatically configure asymmetric-key based
      authentication for SSH

      between Compute Nodes in a Linux Pool when the Pool's
      enableInterNodeCommunication property is

      true (it is ignored if enableInterNodeCommunication is false). It does
      this by placing the key

      pair into the user's .ssh directory. If not specified, password-less SSH
      is not configured

      between Compute Nodes (no modification of the user's .ssh directory is
      done).

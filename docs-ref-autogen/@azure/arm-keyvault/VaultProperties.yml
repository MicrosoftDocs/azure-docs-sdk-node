      is also enabled. Enabling this functionality is irreversible - that is,
      the property does not accept false as its value.

      vault will use Role Based Access Control (RBAC) for authorization of data

      ignored. When false, the key vault will use the access policies specified
      in vault properties, and any policy stored on Azure Resource Manager will
      be ignored. If null or not specified, the vault is created with the
      default value of false. Note that management actions are always authorized
      with RBAC.

      even if a new version becomes available. Please do not use field 'version'
      for gallery image deployment, gallery image should always use 'id' field
      for deployment, to use 'latest' version of gallery image, just set
      '/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/galleries/{galleryName}/images/{imageName}'
      in the 'id' field without version input.

    summary: >-
      Default oversampling factor. Oversampling retrieves a greater set of
      potential documents to offset the resolution loss due to quantization.
      This increases the set of results that will be rescored on full-precision
      vectors. Minimum value is 1, meaning no oversampling (1x). This parameter
      can only be set when 'enableRescoring' is true. Higher values improve
      recall at the expense of latency.

      If set to true, after the initial search on the compressed vectors, the
      similarity scores are recalculated using the full-precision vectors. This
      will improve recall at the expense of latency.

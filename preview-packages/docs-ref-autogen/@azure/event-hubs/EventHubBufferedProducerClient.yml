summary: >-
  The `EventHubBufferedProducerClient`is used to publish events to a specific
  Event Hub.


  The `EventHubBufferedProducerClient` does not publish events immediately.

  Instead, events are buffered so they can be efficiently batched and published

  when the batch is full or the `maxWaitTimeInMs` has elapsed with no new events

  enqueued.


  Depending on the options specified when events are enqueued, they may be

  automatically assigned to a partition, grouped according to the specified
  partition key,

  or assigned a specifically requested partition.


  This model is intended to shift the burden of batch management from callers,
  at the cost of

  non-deterministic timing, for when events will be published. There are
  additional trade-offs

  to consider, as well:

  - If the application crashes, events in the buffer will not have been
  published. To prevent
    data loss, callers are encouraged to track publishing progress using the
    `onSendEventsSuccessHandler` and `onSendEventsErrorHandler` handlers.
  - Events specifying a partition key may be assigned a different partition than
  those using
    the same key with other producers.
  - In the unlikely event that a partition becomes temporarily unavailable, the
    `EventHubBufferedProducerClient` may take longer to recover than other producers.

  In scenarios where it is important to have events published immediately with a
  deterministic

  outcome, ensure that partition keys are assigned to a partition consistent
  with other

  publishers, or where maximizing availability is a requirement, using the

  `EventHubProducerClient` is recommended.

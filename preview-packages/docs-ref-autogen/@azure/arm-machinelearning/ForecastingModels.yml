   this enum contains the known values that the service supports.
  ### Known values supported by the service

  **AutoArima**: Auto-Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model
  uses time-series data and statistical analysis to interpret the data and make
  future predictions.

  This model aims to explain data by using time series data on its past values
  and uses linear regression to make predictions. \

  **Prophet**: Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on
  an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and
  daily seasonality, plus holiday effects.

  It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several
  seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in
  the trend, and typically handles outliers well. \

  **Naive**: The Naive forecasting model makes predictions by carrying forward
  the latest target value for each time-series in the training data. \

  **SeasonalNaive**: The Seasonal Naive forecasting model makes predictions by
  carrying forward the latest season of target values for each time-series in
  the training data. \

  **Average**: The Average forecasting model makes predictions by carrying
  forward the average of the target values for each time-series in the training
  data. \

  **SeasonalAverage**: The Seasonal Average forecasting model makes predictions
  by carrying forward the average value of the latest season of data for each
  time-series in the training data. \

  **ExponentialSmoothing**: Exponential smoothing is a time series forecasting
  method for univariate data that can be extended to support data with a
  systematic trend or seasonal component. \

  **Arimax**: An Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Explanatory
  Variable (ARIMAX) model can be viewed as a multiple regression model with one
  or more autoregressive (AR) terms and\/or one or more moving average (MA)
  terms.

  This method is suitable for forecasting when data is stationary\/non
  stationary, and multivariate with any type of data pattern, i.e., level\/trend
  \/seasonality\/cyclicity. \

  **TCNForecaster**: TCNForecaster: Temporal Convolutional Networks Forecaster.
  \/\/TODO: Ask forecasting team for brief intro. \

  **ElasticNet**: Elastic net is a popular type of regularized linear regression
  that combines two popular penalties, specifically the L1 and L2 penalty
  functions. \

  **GradientBoosting**: The technique of transiting week learners into a strong
  learner is called Boosting. The gradient boosting algorithm process works on
  this theory of execution. \

  **DecisionTree**: Decision Trees are a non-parametric supervised learning
  method used for both classification and regression tasks.

  The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by
  learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features. \

  **KNN**: K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm uses 'feature similarity' to
  predict the values of new datapoints

  which further means that the new data point will be assigned a value based on
  how closely it matches the points in the training set. \

  **LassoLars**: Lasso model fit with Least Angle Regression a.k.a. Lars. It is
  a Linear Model trained with an L1 prior as regularizer. \

  **SGD**: SGD: Stochastic gradient descent is an optimization algorithm often
  used in machine learning applications

  to find the model parameters that correspond to the best fit between predicted
  and actual outputs.

  It's an inexact but powerful technique. \

  **RandomForest**: Random forest is a supervised learning algorithm.

  The "forest" it builds, is an ensemble of decision trees, usually trained with
  the “bagging” method.

  The general idea of the bagging method is that a combination of learning
  models increases the overall result. \

  **ExtremeRandomTrees**: Extreme Trees is an ensemble machine learning
  algorithm that combines the predictions from many decision trees. It is
  related to the widely used random forest algorithm. \

  **LightGBM**: LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree based
  learning algorithms. \

  **XGBoostRegressor**: XGBoostRegressor: Extreme Gradient Boosting Regressor is
  a supervised machine learning model using ensemble of base learners.

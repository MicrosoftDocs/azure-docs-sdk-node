# Azure Face API

The Azure Face service provides AI algorithms that detect, recognize, and analyze human faces in images.

## Setting up

### Create a new Node.js application

In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), create a new directory for your app, and navigate to it.

```console
mkdir myapp && cd myapp
```

Run the `npm init` command to create a node application with a `package.json` file.

```console
npm init
```

### Install the client library

Navigate to your project directory and run the following command to install the `ms-rest-azure` and `azure-cognitiveservices-face` NPM packages:

```console
npm install @azure/cognitiveservices-face @azure/ms-rest-js
```

Your app's `package.json` file will be updated with the dependencies.

## Next Steps

Go to the Face service [Overview](/azure/cognitive-services/face/overview) or follow a [quickstart](/azure/cognitive-services/face/quickstarts/client-libraries) to get started.

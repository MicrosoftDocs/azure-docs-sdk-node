    summary: >-
      The compensating action to perform when a Monitored upgrade encounters
      monitoring policy or

      health policy violations.

      Invalid indicates the failure action is invalid. Rollback specifies that
      the upgrade will

      start rolling back automatically.

      Manual indicates that the upgrade will switch to UnmonitoredManual upgrade
      mode. Possible

      values include: 'Invalid', 'Rollback', 'Manual'

    package: '@azure/servicefabric'
    summary: >-
      The amount of time to retry health evaluation when the application or
      cluster is unhealthy

      before FailureAction is executed. It is first interpreted as a string
      representing an ISO 8601

      duration. If that fails, then it is interpreted as a number representing
      the total number of

      milliseconds.

    summary: >-
      The amount of time that the application or cluster must remain healthy
      before the upgrade

      proceeds to the next upgrade domain. It is first interpreted as a string
      representing an ISO

      8601 duration. If that fails, then it is interpreted as a number
      representing the total number

      of milliseconds.

      The amount of time to wait after completing an upgrade domain before
      applying health policies.

      It is first interpreted as a string representing an ISO 8601 duration. If
      that fails, then it

      is interpreted as a number representing the total number of milliseconds.

    uid: >-
      @azure/servicefabric.RollingUpgradeUpdateDescription.instanceCloseDelayDurationInSeconds
    package: '@azure/servicefabric'
    summary: >-
      Duration in seconds, to wait before a stateless instance is closed, to
      allow the active

      requests to drain gracefully. This would be effective when the instance is
      closing during the

      application/cluster

      upgrade, only for those instances which have a non-zero delay duration
      configured in the

      service description. See InstanceCloseDelayDurationSeconds property in
      $ref:

      "#/definitions/StatelessServiceDescription.yaml" for details.

      Note, the default value of InstanceCloseDelayDurationInSeconds is
      4294967295, which indicates

      that the behavior will entirely depend on the delay configured in the
      stateless service

      description.

      The maximum amount of time to block processing of an upgrade domain and
      prevent loss of

      availability when there are unexpected issues. When this timeout expires,
      processing of the

      upgrade domain will proceed regardless of availability loss issues. The
      timeout is reset at

      the start of each upgrade domain. Valid values are between 0 and
      42949672925 inclusive.

      UnmonitoredAuto,

      UnmonitoredManual, and Monitored. Possible values include: 'Invalid',

      FailureAction is executed. It is

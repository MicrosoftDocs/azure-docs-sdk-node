    summary: >
      Allows filtering the collection of HealthEvent objects returned based on
      health state.

      The possible values for this parameter include integer value of one of the
      following health

      states.

      Only events that match the filter are returned. All events are used to
      evaluate the aggregated

      health state.

      If not specified, all entries are returned. The state values are
      flag-based enumeration, so

      the value could be a combination of these values, obtained using the
      bitwise 'OR' operator.

      For example, If the provided value is 6 then all of the events with
      HealthState value of OK

      (2) and Warning (4) are returned.

      - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.

      - None - Filter that doesn't match any HealthState value. Used in order to
      return no results

      on a given collection of states. The value is 1.

      - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is
      2.

      - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The
      value is 4.

      - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The
      value is 8.

      - All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is
      65535. Default

      value: 0.

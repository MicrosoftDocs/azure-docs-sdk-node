      Indicates whether OS upgrades should automatically be applied to scale set
      instances in a rolling fashion when a newer version of the OS image
      becomes available. Default value is false. If this is set to true for
      Windows based scale sets,
      [enableAutomaticUpdates](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.management.compute.models.windowsconfiguration.enableautomaticupdates?view=azure-dotnet)

    summary: >-
      Indicates whether Auto OS Upgrade should undergo deferral. Deferred OS
      upgrades will send advanced notifications on a per-VM basis that an OS
      upgrade from rolling upgrades is incoming, via the IMDS tag
      'Platform.PendingOSUpgrade'. The upgrade then defers until the upgrade is
      approved via an ApproveRollingUpgrade call.

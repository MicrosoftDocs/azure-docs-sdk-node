  A machine resource represents a discovered computer system. It can be
  *monitored*, i.e., a

  Dependency Agent is running on it, or *discovered*, i.e., its existence was
  inferred by

  observing the data stream from monitored machines. As machines change, prior
  versions of the

  machine resource are preserved and available for access. A machine is live
  during an interval of

  time, if either its Dependency Agent has reported data during (parts) of that
  interval, or a

  Dependency agent running on other machines has reported activity associated
  with the machine.

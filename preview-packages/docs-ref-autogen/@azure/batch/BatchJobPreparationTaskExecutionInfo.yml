    summary: >-
      The exit code of the program specified on the Task command line. This
      parameter is returned only if the Task is in the completed state. The exit
      code for a process reflects the specific convention implemented by the
      application developer for that process. If you use the exit code value to
      make decisions in your code, be sure that you know the exit code
      convention used by the application process. Note that the exit code may
      also be generated by the Compute Node operating system, such as when a
      process is forcibly terminated.

    summary: >-
      The most recent time at which a retry of the Job Preparation Task started
      running. This property is set only if the Task was retried (i.e.
      retryCount is nonzero). If present, this is typically the same as
      startTime, but may be different if the Task has been restarted for reasons
      other than retry; for example, if the Compute Node was rebooted during a
      retry, then the startTime is updated but the lastRetryTime is not.

    summary: >-
      The number of times the Task has been retried by the Batch service. Task
      application failures (non-zero exit code) are retried, pre-processing
      errors (the Task could not be run) and file upload errors are not retried.
      The Batch service will retry the Task up to the limit specified by the
      constraints. Task application failures (non-zero exit code) are retried,
      pre-processing errors (the Task could not be run) and file upload errors
      are not retried. The Batch service will retry the Task up to the limit

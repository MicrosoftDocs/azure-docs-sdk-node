  Multi-instance Tasks are commonly used to support MPI Tasks. In the MPI case,
  if any of the subtasks fail (for example due to exiting with a non-zero exit
  code) the entire multi-instance Task fails. The multi-instance Task is then
  terminated and retried, up to its retry limit.

    summary: >-
      A list of files that the Batch service will download before running the
      coordination command line. The difference between common resource files
      and Task resource files is that common resource files are downloaded for
      all subtasks including the primary, whereas Task resource files are
      downloaded only for the primary. Also note that these resource files are
      not downloaded to the Task working directory, but instead are downloaded
      to the Task root directory (one directory above the working directory). 
      There is a maximum size for the list of resource files.  When the max size
      is exceeded, the request will fail and the response error code will be
      RequestEntityTooLarge. If this occurs, the collection of ResourceFiles
      must be reduced in size. This can be achieved using .zip files,
      Application Packages, or Docker Containers.

      The command line to run on all the Compute Nodes to enable them to
      coordinate when the primary runs the main Task command. A typical
      coordination command line launches a background service and verifies that
      the service is ready to process inter-node messages.

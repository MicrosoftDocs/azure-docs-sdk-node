  - name: Classification
    uid: '@azure/arm-machinelearning.KnownTaskType.Classification'
    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'
    summary: >-
      Classification in machine learning and statistics is a supervised learning
      approach in which

      the computer program learns from the data given to it and make new
      observations or classifications.
  - name: Forecasting
    uid: '@azure/arm-machinelearning.KnownTaskType.Forecasting'
    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'
    summary: >-
      Forecasting is a special kind of regression task that deals with
      time-series data and creates forecasting model

      that can be used to predict the near future values based on the inputs.
  - name: ImageClassification
    uid: '@azure/arm-machinelearning.KnownTaskType.ImageClassification'
    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'
    summary: >-
      Image Classification. Multi-class image classification is used when an
      image is classified with only a single label

      from a set of classes - e.g. each image is classified as either an image
      of a 'cat' or a 'dog' or a 'duck'.
  - name: ImageClassificationMultilabel
    uid: '@azure/arm-machinelearning.KnownTaskType.ImageClassificationMultilabel'
    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'
    summary: >-
      Image Classification Multilabel. Multi-label image classification is used
      when an image could have one or more labels

      from a set of labels - e.g. an image could be labeled with both 'cat' and
      'dog'.
  - name: ImageInstanceSegmentation
    uid: '@azure/arm-machinelearning.KnownTaskType.ImageInstanceSegmentation'
    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'
    summary: >-
      Image Instance Segmentation. Instance segmentation is used to identify
      objects in an image at the pixel level,

      drawing a polygon around each object in the image.
  - name: ImageObjectDetection
    uid: '@azure/arm-machinelearning.KnownTaskType.ImageObjectDetection'
    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'
    summary: >-
      Image Object Detection. Object detection is used to identify objects in an
      image and locate each object with a

      bounding box e.g. locate all dogs and cats in an image and draw a bounding
      box around each.
  - name: Regression
    uid: '@azure/arm-machinelearning.KnownTaskType.Regression'
    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'
    summary: >-
      Regression means to predict the value using the input data. Regression
      models are used to predict a continuous value.
  - name: TextClassification
    uid: '@azure/arm-machinelearning.KnownTaskType.TextClassification'
    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'
    summary: >-
      Text classification (also known as text tagging or text categorization) is
      the process of sorting texts into categories.

      Categories are mutually exclusive.
  - name: TextClassificationMultilabel
    uid: '@azure/arm-machinelearning.KnownTaskType.TextClassificationMultilabel'
    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'
    summary: >-
      Multilabel classification task assigns each sample to a group (zero or
      more) of target labels.

      Text Named Entity Recognition a.k.a. TextNER.

      Named Entity Recognition (NER) is the ability to take free-form text and
      identify the occurrences of entities such as people, locations,
      organizations, and more.

# Azure Media Services modules for JavaScript

Azure Media Services is an extensible cloud-based platform that enables developers to build scalable media management and delivery applications. Media Services is based on REST APIs that enable you to securely upload, store, encode, and package video or audio content for both on-demand and live streaming delivery to various clients (for example, TV, PC, and mobile devices).

With Azure Media Services, you can:
- Build end-to-end workflows using entirely Media Services. 
- Use third-party components for some parts of your workflow. For example, encode using a third-party encoder. Then, upload, protect, package, deliver using Media Services.
- Stream your content live or deliver content on-demand. The topic also links to other relevant topics.

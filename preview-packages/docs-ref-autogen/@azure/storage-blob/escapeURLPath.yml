      ## URL encode and escape strategy for JSv10 SDKs


      When customers pass a URL string into XXXURL classes constrcutor, the URL
      string may already be URL encoded or not.

      But before sending to Azure Storage server, the URL must be encoded.
      However, it's hard for a SDK to guess whether the URL

      string has been encoded or not. We have 2 potential strategies, and chose
      strategy two for the XXXURL constructors.


      ### Strategy One: Assume the customer URL string is not encoded, and
      always encode URL string in SDK.


      This is what legacy V2 SDK does, simple and works for most of the cases.

      - When customer URL string is
      "http://account.blob.core.windows.net/con/b:",
        SDK will encode it to "http://account.blob.core.windows.net/con/b%3A" and send to server. A blob named "b:" will be created.
      - When customer URL string is
      "http://account.blob.core.windows.net/con/b%3A",
        SDK will encode it to "http://account.blob.core.windows.net/con/b%253A" and send to server. A blob named "b%3A" will be created.

      But this strategy will make it not possible to create a blob with "?" in
      it's name. Because when customer URL string is

      "http://account.blob.core.windows.net/con/blob?name", the "?name" will be
      treated as URL paramter instead of blob name.

      If customer URL string is
      "http://account.blob.core.windows.net/con/blob%3Fname", a blob named
      "blob%3Fname" will be created.

      V2 SDK doesn't have this issue because it doesn't allow customer pass in a
      full URL, it accepts a separate blob name and encodeURIComponent for it.

      We cannot accept a SDK cannot create a blob name with "?". So we implement
      strategy two:


      ### Strategy Two: SDK doesn't assume the URL has been encoded or not. It
      will just escape the special characters.


      This is what V10 Blob Go SDK does. It accepts a URL type in Go, and call
      url.EscapedPath() to escape the special chars unescaped.

      - When customer URL string is
      "http://account.blob.core.windows.net/con/b:",
        SDK will escape ":" like "http://account.blob.core.windows.net/con/b%3A" and send to server. A blob named "b:" will be created.
      - When customer URL string is
      "http://account.blob.core.windows.net/con/b%3A",
        There is no special characters, so send "http://account.blob.core.windows.net/con/b%3A" to server. A blob named "b:" will be created.
      - When customer URL string is
      "http://account.blob.core.windows.net/con/b%253A",
        There is no special characters, so send "http://account.blob.core.windows.net/con/b%253A" to server. A blob named "b%3A" will be created.

      This strategy gives us flexibility to create with any special characters.
      But "%" will be treated as a special characters, if the URL string

      is not encoded, there shouldn't a "%" in the URL string, otherwise the URL
      is not a valid URL.

      If customer needs to create a blob with "%" in it's blob name, use "%25"
      insead of "%". Just like above 3rd sample.

      And following URL strings are invalid:

      - "http://account.blob.core.windows.net/con/b%"

      - "http://account.blob.core.windows.net/con/b%2"

      - "http://account.blob.core.windows.net/con/b%G"


      Another special character is "?", use "%2F" to represent a blob name with
      "?" in a URL string.


      ### Strategy for containerName, blobName or other specific XXXName
      parameters in methods such as `BlobURL.fromContainerURL(containerURL,
      blobName)`


      We will apply strategy one, and call encodeURIComponent for these
      parameters like blobName. Because what customers passes in is a plain name
      instead of a URL.
    syntax:
      content: 'function escapeURLPath(url: string)'
      parameters:
        - id: url
          type:
            - string
          description: ''
      return:
        type:
          - string
    package: '@azure/storage-blob'

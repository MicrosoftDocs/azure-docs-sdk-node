      The default value is currentUser. This property is applicable only for
      pools

      configured with Windows nodes (that is, created with
      cloudServiceConfiguration, or with

      virtualMachineConfiguration using a Windows image reference). For Linux
      compute nodes, the

      certificates are stored in a directory inside the task working directory
      and an environment

      variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to query for
      this location. For

      certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs' directory is
      created in the user's

      home directory (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed
      in that directory.

      Possible values include: 'CurrentUser', 'LocalMachine'

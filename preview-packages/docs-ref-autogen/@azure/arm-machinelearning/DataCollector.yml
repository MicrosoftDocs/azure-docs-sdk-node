      [Required] The collection configuration. Each collection has it own
      configuration to collect model data and the name of collection can be
      arbitrary string.

      Model data collector can be used for either payload logging or custom
      logging or both of them. Collection request and response are reserved for
      payload logging, others are for custom logging.

    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'
    summary: >-
      When model data is collected to blob storage, we need to roll the data to
      different path to avoid logging all of them in a single blob file.

      If the rolling rate is hour, all data will be collected in the blob path
      /yyyy/MM/dd/HH/.

      If it's day, all data will be collected in blob path /yyyy/MM/dd/.

      The other benefit of rolling path is that model monitoring ui is able to
      select a time range of data very quickly.

      The set of actions the Personalizer service can pick from.

      The set should not contain more than 50 actions.

      The order of the actions does not affect the rank result but the order

      should match the sequence your application would have used to display
      them.

      Send false if the user will see the rank results, therefore

      Personalizer will expect a Reward call, otherwise it will assign the
      default

      Reward to the event. Send true if it is possible the user will not see the

      rank results, because the page is rendering later, or the Rank results may
      be

      overridden by code further downstream. Default value: false.

      If null, the service generates a unique eventId. The eventId will be used

      pseudo-random

      generator when making a Personalizer call.

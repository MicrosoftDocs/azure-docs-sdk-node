  [KnownVMCategory](xref:@azure/arm-computefleet.KnownVMCategory) can be used
  interchangeably with VMCategory,
   this enum contains the known values that the service supports.
  ### Known values supported by the service

  **GeneralPurpose**: General purpose VM sizes provide balanced CPU-to-memory
  ratio. Ideal for testing and development, small to medium databases, and low
  to medium traffic web servers. \

  **ComputeOptimized**: Compute optimized VM sizes have a high CPU-to-memory
  ratio. These sizes are good for medium traffic web servers, network
  appliances, batch processes, and application servers. \

  **MemoryOptimized**: Memory optimized VM sizes offer a high memory-to-CPU
  ratio that is great for relational database servers, medium to large caches,
  and in-memory analytics. \

  **StorageOptimized**: Storage optimized virtual machine (VM) sizes offer high
  disk throughput and IO, and are ideal for Big Data, SQL, NoSQL databases, data
  warehousing, and large transactional databases.

  Examples include Cassandra, MongoDB, Cloudera, and Redis. \

  **GpuAccelerated**: GPU optimized VM sizes are specialized virtual machines
  available with single, multiple, or fractional GPUs.

  These sizes are designed for compute-intensive, graphics-intensive, and
  visualization workloads. \

  **FpgaAccelerated**: FPGA optimized VM sizes are specialized virtual machines
  available with single or multiple FPGA.

  These sizes are designed for compute-intensive workloads. This article
  provides information about the number and type of FPGA, vCPUs, data disks, and
  NICs.

  Storage throughput and network bandwidth are also included for each size in
  this grouping. \

  **HighPerformanceCompute**: Azure High Performance Compute VMs are optimized
  for various HPC workloads such as computational fluid dynamics, finite element
  analysis, frontend and backend EDA,

  rendering, molecular dynamics, computational geo science, weather simulation,
  and financial risk analysis.

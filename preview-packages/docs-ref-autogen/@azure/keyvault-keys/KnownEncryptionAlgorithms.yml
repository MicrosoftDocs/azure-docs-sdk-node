      [Not recommended] RSAES-PKCS1-V1_5 key encryption, as described in
      https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447. Microsoft recommends using
      RSA_OAEP_256 or stronger algorithms for enhanced security. Microsoft does
      *not* recommend RSA_1_5, which is included solely for backwards
      compatibility. Cryptographic standards no longer consider RSA with the
      PKCS#1 v1.5 padding scheme secure for encryption.

      [Not recommended] RSAES using Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding
      (OAEP), as described in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447, with the
      default parameters specified by RFC 3447 in Section A.2.1. Those default
      parameters are using a hash function of SHA-1 and a mask generation
      function of MGF1 with SHA-1. Microsoft recommends using RSA_OAEP_256 or
      stronger algorithms for enhanced security. Microsoft does *not* recommend
      RSA_OAEP, which is included solely for backwards compatibility. RSA_OAEP
      utilizes SHA1, which has known collision problems.

      to create the virtual machine. **FromImage:** This value is used when you
      are using an image to create the virtual machine. If you are using a
      platform image, you should also use the imageReference element described

      Possible values are: **Delete.** If this value is used, the OS disk is
      deleted when VM is deleted. **Detach.** If this value is used, the os disk
      is retained after VM is deleted. The default value is set to **Detach**.
      For an ephemeral OS Disk, the default value is set to **Delete**. The user
      cannot change the delete option for an ephemeral OS Disk.

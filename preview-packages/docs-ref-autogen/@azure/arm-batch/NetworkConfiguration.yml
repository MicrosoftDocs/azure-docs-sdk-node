      a VM, which may lead to improved networking performance. For more details,

    summary: >-
      The virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as the
      Azure Batch account. The specified subnet should have enough free IP
      addresses to accommodate the number of nodes in the pool. If the subnet
      doesn't have enough free IP addresses, the pool will partially allocate
      compute nodes and a resize error will occur. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch'
      service principal must have the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor'
      Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) role for the specified VNet. The
      specified subnet must allow communication from the Azure Batch service to
      be able to schedule tasks on the compute nodes. This can be verified by
      checking if the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups
      (NSG). If communication to the compute nodes in the specified subnet is
      denied by an NSG, then the Batch service will set the state of the compute
      nodes to unusable. If the specified VNet has any associated Network
      Security Groups (NSG), then a few reserved system ports must be enabled
      for inbound communication. Enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well as port
      22 for Linux and port 3389 for Windows. Also enable outbound connections
      to Azure Storage on port 443. For more details see:

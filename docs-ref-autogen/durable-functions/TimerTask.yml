### YamlMime:TSType
name: TimerTask
uid: durable-functions.TimerTask
package: durable-functions
summary: |+
  Returned from [[DurableOrchestrationClient]].[[createTimer]] if the call is
  not `yield`-ed. Represents a pending timer. See documentation on [[Task]]
  for more information.
  All pending timers must be completed or canceled for an orchestration to
  complete.


  **Example**

  Cancel a timer
  ```javascript
  // calculate expiration date
  const timeoutTask = context.df.createTimer(expirationDate);

  // do some work

  if (!timeoutTask.isCompleted) {
      // An orchestration won't get marked as completed until all its scheduled
      // tasks have returned, or been cancelled. Therefore, it is important
      // to cancel timers when they're no longer needed
      timeoutTask.cancel();
  }
  ```



  **Example**

  Create a timeout
  ```javascript
  const now = Date.now();
  const expiration = new Date(now.valueOf()).setMinutes(now.getMinutes() + 30);

  const timeoutTask = context.df.createTimer(expirationDate);
  const otherTask = context.df.callActivity("DoWork");

  const winner = yield context.df.Task.any([timeoutTask, otherTask]);

  if (winner === otherTask) {
      // do some more work
  }

  if (!timeoutTask.isCompleted) {
      // An orchestration won't get marked as completed until all its scheduled
      // tasks have returned, or been cancelled. Therefore, it is important
      // to cancel timers when they're no longer needed
      timeoutTask.cancel();
  }
  ```

      A port resource represents a server port on a machine. The port may be

      actively *monitored*, i.e., a Dependency Agent is running on its machine,
      or

      *discovered*, i.e., its existence was inferred by observing the data
      stream

      from monitored machines. A port is live during an interval of time, if
      that

      port had associated activity during (parts) of that interval.

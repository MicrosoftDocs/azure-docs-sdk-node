      Batch will retry tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a compute
      node. Examples of

      recovery operations include (but are not limited to) when an unhealthy
      compute node is rebooted

      or a compute node disappeared due to host failure. Retries due to recovery
      operations are

      independent of and are not counted against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if
      the maxTaskRetryCount

      is 0, an internal retry due to a recovery operation may occur. Because of
      this, all tasks should

      be idempotent. This means tasks need to tolerate being interrupted and
      restarted without causing

      any corruption or duplicate data. The best practice for long running tasks
      is to use some form

      of checkpointing. In some cases the start task may be re-run even though
      the node was not

      rebooted. Special care should be taken to avoid start tasks which create
      breakaway process or

      install/launch services from the start task working directory, as this
      will block Batch from

      being able to re-run the start task.

      The maximum number of times the task may be retried. The Batch service

      exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls the
      number of retries. The

      Batch service will try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit.
      For example, if the

      maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial
      try and 3 retries).

      If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the
      task. If the maximum

      retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the task without limit.

      Whether the Batch service should wait for the start task to complete
      successfully (that is, to

      exit with exit code 0) before scheduling any tasks on the compute node. If
      true and the start

      task fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the start task up
      to its maximum retry

      count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task has still not completed
      successfully after all retries,

      then the Batch service marks the compute node unusable, and will not
      schedule tasks to it.

      This condition can be detected via the node state and failure info
      details. If false, the

      Batch service will not wait for the start task to complete. In this case,
      other tasks can

      start executing on the compute node while the start task is still running;
      and even if the

      start task fails, new tasks will continue to be scheduled on the node. The
      default is false.

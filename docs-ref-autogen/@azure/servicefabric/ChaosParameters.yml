      List of cluster entities to target for Chaos faults.

      This filter can be used to target Chaos faults only to certain node types
      or only to certain

      application instances. If ChaosTargetFilter is not used, Chaos faults all
      cluster entities.

      If ChaosTargetFilter is used, Chaos faults only the entities that meet the
      ChaosTargetFilter

      specification.

      minutes before the next health-check.

      (key or value) can be

    summary: >-
      The maximum amount of time to wait for all cluster entities to become
      stable and healthy.

      Chaos executes in iterations and at the start of each iteration it
      validates the health of

      cluster entities.

      During validation if a cluster entity is not stable and healthy within

      MaxClusterStabilizationTimeoutInSeconds, Chaos generates a validation
      failed event. Default

      value: 60.

    summary: >-
      MaxConcurrentFaults is the maximum number of concurrent faults induced per
      iteration.

      Chaos executes in iterations and two consecutive iterations are separated
      by a validation

      phase.

      The higher the concurrency, the more aggressive the injection of faults,
      leading to inducing

      more complex series of states to uncover bugs.

      The recommendation is to start with a value of 2 or 3 and to exercise
      caution while moving up.

      Default value: 1.

      Wait time (in seconds) between consecutive faults within a single

      The larger the value, the lower the overlapping between faults and the
      simpler the sequence of

      state transitions that the cluster goes through.

      The recommendation is to start with a value between 1 and 5 and exercise
      caution while moving

      up. Default value: 20.

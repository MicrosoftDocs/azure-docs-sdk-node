summary: >-
  Video sink allows for video and audio to be recorded to the Video Analyzer
  service. The recorded video can be played from anywhere and further managed
  from the cloud. Due to security reasons, a given Video Analyzer edge module
  instance can only record content to new video entries, or existing video
  entries previously recorded by the same module. Any attempt to record content
  to an existing video which has not been created by the same module instance
  will result in failure to record.

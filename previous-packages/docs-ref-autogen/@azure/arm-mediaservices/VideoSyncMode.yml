   this enum contains the known values that the service supports.
  ### Known values supported by the service

  **Auto**: This is the default method. Chooses between Cfr and Vfr depending on
  muxer capabilities. For output format MP4, the default mode is Cfr. \

  **Passthrough**: The presentation timestamps on frames are passed through from
  the input file to the output file writer. Recommended when the input source
  has variable frame rate, and are attempting to produce multiple layers for
  adaptive streaming in the output which have aligned GOP boundaries. Note: if
  two or more frames in the input have duplicate timestamps, then the output
  will also have the same behavior \

  **Cfr**: Input frames will be repeated and/or dropped as needed to achieve
  exactly the requested constant frame rate. Recommended when the output frame
  rate is explicitly set at a specified value \

  **Vfr**: Similar to the Passthrough mode, but if the input has frames that
  have duplicate timestamps, then only one frame is passed through to the
  output, and others are dropped. Recommended when the number of output frames
  is expected to be equal to the number of input frames. For example, the output
  is used to calculate a quality metric like PSNR against the input

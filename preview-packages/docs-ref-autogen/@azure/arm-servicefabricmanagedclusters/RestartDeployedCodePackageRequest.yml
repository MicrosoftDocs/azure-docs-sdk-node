    summary: >-
      The instance ID for currently running entry point. For a code package
      setup entry point (if specified) runs first and after it finishes main
      entry point is started. Each time entry point executable is run, its
      instance ID will change. If 0 is passed in as the code package instance
      ID, the API will restart the code package with whatever instance ID it is
      currently running. If an instance ID other than 0 is passed in, the API
      will restart the code package only if the current Instance ID matches the
      passed in instance ID. Note, passing in the exact instance ID (not 0) in
      the API is safer, because if ensures at most one restart of the code
      package.

      to 'SharedProcess'), then value of ServicePackageActivationId is always an
      empty string.

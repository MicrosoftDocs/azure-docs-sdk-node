    summary: |
      Whether to apply a greedy or a more balanced approach when
      claiming partitions.
      - balanced: The `EventHubConsumerClient` will take a measured approach to
      requesting partition ownership when balancing work with other clients,
      slowly claiming partitions until a stabilized distribution is achieved.

      - greedy: The `EventHubConsumerClient` will attempt to claim ownership
      of its fair share of partitions aggressively when balancing work with
      other clients.

      This option is ignored when either:
        - `CheckpointStore` is __not__ provided to the `EventHubConsumerClient`.
        - `subscribe()` is called for a single partition.

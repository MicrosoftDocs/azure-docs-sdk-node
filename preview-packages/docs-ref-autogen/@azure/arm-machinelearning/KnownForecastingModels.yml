    summary: >-
      An Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Explanatory Variable
      (ARIMAX) model can be viewed as a multiple regression model with one or
      more autoregressive (AR) terms and/or one or more moving average (MA)
      terms.

      This method is suitable for forecasting when data is stationary/non
      stationary, and multivariate with any type of data pattern, i.e.,
      level/trend /seasonality/cyclicity.

    uid: '@azure/arm-machinelearning.KnownForecastingModels.AutoArima'
    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'
    summary: >-
      Auto-Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model uses
      time-series data and statistical analysis to interpret the data and make
      future predictions.

      This model aims to explain data by using time series data on its past
      values and uses linear regression to make predictions.

    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'
    summary: >-
      Decision Trees are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for
      both classification and regression tasks.

      The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable
      by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.
  - name: ElasticNet
    uid: '@azure/arm-machinelearning.KnownForecastingModels.ElasticNet'
    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'

    uid: '@azure/arm-machinelearning.KnownForecastingModels.GradientBoosting'
    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'
    summary: >-
      The technique of transiting week learners into a strong learner is called
      Boosting. The gradient boosting algorithm process works on this theory of
      execution.
  - name: KNN
    uid: '@azure/arm-machinelearning.KnownForecastingModels.KNN'
    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'
    summary: >-
      K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm uses 'feature similarity' to predict
      the values of new datapoints

      which further means that the new data point will be assigned a value based
      on how closely it matches the points in the training set.
  - name: LassoLars
    uid: '@azure/arm-machinelearning.KnownForecastingModels.LassoLars'
    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'
    summary: >-

      latest target value for each time-series in the training data.
  - name: Prophet
    uid: '@azure/arm-machinelearning.KnownForecastingModels.Prophet'
    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'
    summary: >-
      Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an
      additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and
      daily seasonality, plus holiday effects.

      It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and
      several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and
      shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well.
  - name: RandomForest
    uid: '@azure/arm-machinelearning.KnownForecastingModels.RandomForest'
    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'
    summary: >-
      Random forest is a supervised learning algorithm.

      The "forest" it builds, is an ensemble of decision trees, usually trained
      with the “bagging” method.

      The general idea of the bagging method is that a combination of learning
      models increases the overall result.

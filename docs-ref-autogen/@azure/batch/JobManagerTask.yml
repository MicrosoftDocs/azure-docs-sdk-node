  The Job Manager Task is automatically started when the Job is created. The
  Batch service tries

  to schedule the Job Manager Task before any other Tasks in the Job. When
  shrinking a Pool, the

  Batch service tries to preserve Nodes where Job Manager Tasks are running for
  as long as

  possible (that is, Compute Nodes running 'normal' Tasks are removed before
  Compute Nodes running

  Job Manager Tasks). When a Job Manager Task fails and needs to be restarted,
  the system tries to

  schedule it at the highest priority. If there are no idle Compute Nodes
  available, the system

  may terminate one of the running Tasks in the Pool and return it to the queue
  in order to make

  room for the Job Manager Task to restart. Note that a Job Manager Task in one
  Job does not have

  priority over Tasks in other Jobs. Across Jobs, only Job level priorities are
  observed. For

  example, if a Job Manager in a priority 0 Job needs to be restarted, it will
  not displace Tasks

  of a priority 1 Job. Batch will retry Tasks when a recovery operation is
  triggered on a Node.

  Examples of recovery operations include (but are not limited to) when an
  unhealthy Node is

  rebooted or a Compute Node disappeared due to host failure. Retries due to
  recovery operations

  are independent of and are not counted against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if
  the

  maxTaskRetryCount is 0, an internal retry due to a recovery operation may
  occur. Because of

  this, all Tasks should be idempotent. This means Tasks need to tolerate being
  interrupted and

  restarted without causing any corruption or duplicate data. The best practice
  for long running

  Tasks is to use some form of checkpointing.

      operations without

      AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN

      environment variable. The operations that the Task can carry out using the
      token depend on the

      settings. For example, a Task can request Job permissions in order to add
      other Tasks to the

      Job, or check the status of the Job or of other Tasks under the Job.

      Whether completion of the Job Manager Task signifies completion of the

      when the Job Manager Task completes, the Batch service marks the Job as
      complete. If any Tasks

      are still running at this time (other than Job Release), those Tasks are
      terminated. If false,

      the completion of the Job Manager Task does not affect the Job status. In
      this case, you

      should either use the onAllTasksComplete attribute to terminate the Job,
      or have a client or

      user terminate the Job explicitly. An example of this is if the Job
      Manager creates a set of

      Tasks but then takes no further role in their execution. The default value
      is true. If you are

      using the onAllTasksComplete and onTaskFailure attributes to control Job
      lifetime, and using

      the Job Manager Task only to create the Tasks for the Job (not to monitor
      progress), then it

      is important to set killJobOnCompletion to false.

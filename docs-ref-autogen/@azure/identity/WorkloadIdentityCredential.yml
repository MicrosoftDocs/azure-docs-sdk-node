  Workload Identity authentication is a feature in Azure that allows
  applications running on virtual machines (VMs)

  to access other Azure resources without the need for a service principal or
  managed identity. With Workload Identity

  authentication, applications authenticate themselves using their own identity,
  rather than using a shared service

  principal or managed identity. Under the hood, Workload Identity
  authentication uses the concept of Service Account

  Credentials (SACs), which are automatically created by Azure and stored
  securely in the VM. By using Workload

  Identity authentication, you can avoid the need to manage and rotate service
  principals or managed identities for

  each application on each VM. Additionally, because SACs are created
  automatically and managed by Azure, you don't

  need to worry about storing and securing sensitive credentials themselves.

  The WorkloadIdentityCredential supports Azure workload identity authentication
  on Azure Kubernetes and acquires

  a token using the SACs available in the Azure Kubernetes environment.

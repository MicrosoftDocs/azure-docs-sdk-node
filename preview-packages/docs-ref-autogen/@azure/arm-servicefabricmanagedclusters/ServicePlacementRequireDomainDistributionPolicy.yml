summary: >-
  Describes the policy to be used for placement of a Service Fabric service
  where two replicas

  from the same partition should never be placed in the same fault or upgrade
  domain.


  While this is not common it can expose the service to an increased risk of
  concurrent failures

  due to unplanned outages or other cases of subsequent/concurrent failures. As
  an example, consider

  a case where replicas are deployed across different data center, with one
  replica per location.

  In the event that one of the datacenters goes offline, normally the replica
  that was placed in that

  datacenter will be packed into one of the remaining datacenters. If this is
  not desirable then this

  policy should be set.

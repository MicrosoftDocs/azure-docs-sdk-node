      An opaque string representing the location of a Compute Node or a Task
      that has run

      previously. You can pass the affinityId of a Node to indicate that this
      Task needs to run on

      that Compute Node. Note that this is just a soft affinity. If the target
      Compute Node is busy

      or unavailable at the time the Task is scheduled, then the Task will be
      scheduled elsewhere.

      Allows you to configure the encoder settings to control the balance
      between speed and quality. Example: set Complexity as Speed for faster
      encoding but less compression efficiency.

    summary: >-
      Sets the interleave mode of the output to control how audio and video are
      stored in the container format. Example: set InterleavedOutput as
      NonInterleavedOutput to produce audio-only and video-only outputs in
      separate MP4 files.

      The maximum bitrate in bits per second (threshold for the top video

      bitrate outputs for contents with high complexity.

      of the encoding job.

      The minimum bitrate in bits per second (threshold for the bottom video
      layer). Example: set MinBitrateBps as 200000 to have a bottom layer that
      covers users with low network bandwidth.

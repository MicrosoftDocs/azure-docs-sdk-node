      The default value is currentUser. This property is applicable only for
      pools configured with Windows compute nodes. For Linux compute nodes, the
      certificates are stored in a directory inside the task working directory
      and an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the
      task to query for this location. For certificates with visibility of
      'remoteUser', a 'certs' directory is created in the user's home directory
      (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed in that
      directory.

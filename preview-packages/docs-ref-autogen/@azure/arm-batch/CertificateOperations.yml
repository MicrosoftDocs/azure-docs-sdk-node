      If you try to delete a certificate that is being used by a pool or compute
      node, the status of the

      certificate changes to deleteFailed. If you decide that you want to
      continue using the certificate,

      you can use this operation to set the status of the certificate back to
      active. If you intend to

      delete the certificate, you do not need to run this operation after the
      deletion failed. You must

      make sure that the certificate is not being used by any resources, and
      then you can try again to

      delete the certificate.

      Acquire the lease on the desired partition for this EventProcessorHost.

      Note that it is legal to acquire a lease that is already owned by another
      host.

      Lease-stealing is how partitions are redistributed when additional hosts
      are started.


      The existing Azure Storage implementation can experience races between two
      host instances

      attempting to acquire or steal the lease at the same time. To avoid
      situations where two host

      instances both believe that they own the lease, acquisition can fail
      without errors by

      returning false and should do so when there is any doubt -- the worst that
      can happen is that

      no host instance owns the lease for a short time. This is qualitatively
      different from,

      for example, the underlying store throwing an access exception, which is
      an error.

      Allows a lease manager implementation to specify to PartitionManager how
      often it should

      scan leases and renew them. In order to redistribute leases in a timely
      fashion after a host

      ceases operating, we recommend a relatively short interval, such as ten
      seconds. Obviously it

      should be less than half of the lease length, to prevent accidental
      expiration.

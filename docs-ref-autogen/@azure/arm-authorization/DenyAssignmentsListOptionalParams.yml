      The filter to apply on the operation. Use $filter=atScope() to return all
      deny assignments at or above the scope. Use $filter=denyAssignmentName eq
      '{name}' to search deny assignments by name at specified scope. Use
      $filter=principalId eq '{id}' to return all deny assignments at, above and
      below the scope for the specified principal. Use
      $filter=gdprExportPrincipalId eq '{id}' to return all deny assignments at,
      above and below the scope for the specified principal. This filter is
      different from the principalId filter as it returns not only those deny
      assignments that contain the specified principal is the Principals list
      but also those deny assignments that contain the specified principal is
      the ExcludePrincipals list. Additionally, when gdprExportPrincipalId
      filter is used, only the deny assignment name and description properties
      are returned.

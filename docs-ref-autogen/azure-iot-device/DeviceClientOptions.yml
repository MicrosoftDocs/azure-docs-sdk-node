      Public certificate in PEM form for certificate authority being used by the
      Hub service.  This is the CA that the hub is using

      to secure TLS connections and the client validates the connection using
      this public cert in order to validate the identity of

      the hub.  If you are connecting to an Azure IoT Hub inside of an Azure
      data center, you do not need to set this.  If you are

      connecting to some other hub (e.g. an Edge Hub), then you may need to set
      this to the server cert that the hub uses for TLS.

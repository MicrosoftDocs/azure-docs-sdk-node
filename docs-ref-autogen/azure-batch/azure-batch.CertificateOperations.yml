      Deletes a certificate from the specified account.


      You cannot delete a certificate if a resource (pool or compute node) is

      using it. Before you can delete a certificate, you must therefore make
      sure

      that the certificate is not associated with any existing pools, the

      certificate is not installed on any compute nodes (even if you remove a

      certificate from a pool, it is not removed from existing compute nodes in

      that pool until they restart), and no running tasks depend on the

      certificate. If you try to delete a certificate that is in use, the
      deletion

      fails. The certificate status changes to deletefailed. You can use Cancel

      Delete Certificate to set the status back to active if you decide that you

      want to continue using the certificate.

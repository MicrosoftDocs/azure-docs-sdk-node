      The maximum duration, in milliseconds, that the lock on the message will
      be renewed automatically by the client.

      This auto renewal stops once the message is settled.

      - **Default**: `300 * 1000` milliseconds (5 minutes).

      - **To disable autolock renewal**, set this to `0`.


      **Example:**

         If the message lock expires in 2 minutes and your message processing time is 8 minutes...

         Set maxAutoLockRenewalDurationInMs to 10 minutes, and the message lock will be automatically renewed for 4 times
         (equivalent to having the message locked for 4 times its lock duration by leveraging the lock renewals).

      Represents the receive mode for the receiver.

      In receiveAndDelete mode, messages are deleted from Service Bus as they
      are received.


      In peekLock mode, the receiver has a lock on the message for the duration
      specified on the

      queue/subscription.


      Messages that are not settled within the lock duration will be redelivered
      as many times as

      the max delivery count set on the queue/subscription, after which they get
      sent to a separate

      dead letter queue.


      You can settle a message by calling complete(), abandon(), defer() or
      deadletter() methods on

      the message.

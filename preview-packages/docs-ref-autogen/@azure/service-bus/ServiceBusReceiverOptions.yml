      Represents the receive mode for the receiver.

      In receiveAndDelete mode, messages are deleted from Service Bus as they
      are received.


      In peekLock mode, the receiver has a lock on the message for the duration
      specified on the

      queue/subscription.


      Messages that are not settled within the lock duration will be redelivered
      as many times as

      the max delivery count set on the queue/subscription, after which they get
      sent to a separate

      dead letter queue.


      You can settle a message by calling complete(), abandon(), defer() or
      deadletter() methods on

      the message.

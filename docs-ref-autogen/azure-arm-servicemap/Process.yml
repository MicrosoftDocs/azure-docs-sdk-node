    summary: "A process resource represents a process running on a machine. The process\rmay be actively *monitored*, i.e., a Dependency Agent is running on its\rmachine, or *discovered*, i.e., its existence was inferred by observing the\rdata stream from monitored machines. A process resource represents a pool of\ractual operating system resources that share command lines and metadata. As\rthe process pool evolves over time, prior versions of the process resource\rare preserved and available for access. A process is live during an interval\rof time, if that process is executing during (parts) of that interval"

    summary: >-
      Health statuses have following meanings. The 'healthy' status shows that
      the endpoint is accepting messages as expected. The 'unhealthy' status
      shows that the endpoint is not accepting messages as expected and IoT Hub
      is retrying to send data to this endpoint. The status of an unhealthy
      endpoint will be updated to healthy when IoT Hub has established an
      eventually consistent state of health. The 'dead' status shows that the
      endpoint is not accepting messages, after IoT Hub retried sending messages
      for the retrial period. See IoT Hub metrics to identify errors and monitor
      issues with endpoints. The 'unknown' status shows that the IoT Hub has not
      established a connection with the endpoint. No messages have been
      delivered to or rejected from this endpoint

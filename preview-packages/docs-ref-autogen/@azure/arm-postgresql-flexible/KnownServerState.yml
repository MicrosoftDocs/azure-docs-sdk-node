    summary: >-
      Server is disabled. Typical reasons include: the subscription on which the
      server is deployed is explicitly disabled or canceled by the
      administrator, the spending limit has been reached, or the bill is past
      due. May also happen when the server is being moved to another resource
      group or subscription.

    summary: >-
      Server is healthy and not undergoing any operations at the management or
      control plane level. This doesn't mean that the server is fully
      operational at the data plane level.

    package: '@azure/arm-postgresql-flexible'
    summary: >-
      Compute resources associated with the server are being stopped and
      deallocated. If the server has high availability enabled, the compute
      resources of the standby server are also stopped and deallocated.
  - name: Updating
    uid: '@azure/arm-postgresql-flexible.KnownServerState.Updating'
    package: '@azure/arm-postgresql-flexible'
    summary: >-
      Server is undergoing some changes which may or may not impact the
      availability of the PostgreSQL database engine. For example, the compute
      resources of the server are being scaled up or down, which may cause
      temporary unavailability of the database engine. Or, for example, a
      firewall rule is being added or removed, which doesn't cause any
      unavailability of the database engine.

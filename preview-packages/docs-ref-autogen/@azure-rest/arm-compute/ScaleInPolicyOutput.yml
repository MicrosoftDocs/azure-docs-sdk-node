      have to be force deleted when a virtual machine scale set is being
      scaled-in.(Feature in Preview)

      The rules to be followed when scaling-in a virtual machine scale set.
      <br><br> Possible values are: <br><br> **Default** When a virtual machine
      scale set is scaled in, the scale set will first be balanced across zones
      if it is a zonal scale set. Then, it will be balanced across Fault Domains
      as far as possible. Within each Fault Domain, the virtual machines chosen
      for removal will be the newest ones that are not protected from scale-in.
      <br><br> **OldestVM** When a virtual machine scale set is being scaled-in,
      the oldest virtual machines that are not protected from scale-in will be
      chosen for removal. For zonal virtual machine scale sets, the scale set
      will first be balanced across zones. Within each zone, the oldest virtual
      machines that are not protected will be chosen for removal. <br><br>
      **NewestVM** When a virtual machine scale set is being scaled-in, the
      newest virtual machines that are not protected from scale-in will be
      chosen for removal. For zonal virtual machine scale sets, the scale set
      will first be balanced across zones. Within each zone, the newest virtual
      machines that are not protected will be chosen for removal. <br><br>

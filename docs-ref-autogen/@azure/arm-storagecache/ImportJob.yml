    summary: >-
      How the import job will handle conflicts. For example, if the import job
      is trying to bring in a directory, but a file is at that path, how it
      handles it. Fail indicates that the import job should stop immediately and
      not do anything with the conflict. Skip indicates that it should pass over
      the conflict. OverwriteIfDirty causes the import job to delete and
      re-import the file or directory if it is a conflicting type, is dirty, or
      was not previously imported. OverwriteAlways extends OverwriteIfDirty to
      include releasing files that had been restored but were not dirty. Please
      reference https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-managed-lustre/
      for a thorough explanation of these resolution modes.

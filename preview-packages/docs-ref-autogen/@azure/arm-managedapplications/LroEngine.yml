      Returns the state of the operation.

      Even though TState will be the same type inside any of the methods of any
      extension of the Poller class,

      implementations of the pollers can customize what's shared with the public
      by writing their own

      version of the `getOperationState` method, and by defining two types, one
      representing the internal state of the poller

      and a public type representing a safe to share subset of the properties of
      the internal state.

      Their definition of getOperationState can then return their public type.


      Example:


      ```ts

      // Let's say we have our poller's operation state defined as:

      interface MyOperationState extends PollOperationState<ResultType> {
        privateProperty?: string;
        publicProperty?: string;
      }


      // To allow us to have a true separation of public and private state, we
      have to define another interface:

      interface PublicState extends PollOperationState<ResultType> {
        publicProperty?: string;
      }


      // Then, we define our Poller as follows:

      export class MyPoller extends Poller<MyOperationState, ResultType> {
        // ... More content is needed here ...

        public getOperationState(): PublicState {
          const state: PublicState = this.operation.state;
          return {
            // Properties from PollOperationState<TResult>
            isStarted: state.isStarted,
            isCompleted: state.isCompleted,
            isCancelled: state.isCancelled,
            error: state.error,
            result: state.result,

            // The only other property needed by PublicState.
            publicProperty: state.publicProperty
          }
        }
      }

      ```


      You can see this in the tests of this repository, go to the file:

      `../test/utils/testPoller.ts`

      and look for the getOperationState implementation.

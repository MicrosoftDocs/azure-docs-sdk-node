  This is a helper class to construct a string representing the permissions
  granted by an AccountSAS. Setting a value

  to true means that any SAS which uses these permissions will grant permissions
  for that operation. Once all the

  values are set, this should be serialized with toString and set as the
  permissions field on an

  [AccountSASSignatureValues](xref:@azure/storage-queue.AccountSASSignatureValues)
  object. It is possible to construct the permissions string without this class,
  but

  the order of the permissions is particular and this class guarantees
  correctness.

  The `EventHubProducerClient` class is used to send events to an Event Hub.

  There are multiple ways to create an `EventHubProducerClient`

  - Use the connection string from the SAS policy created for your Event Hub
  instance.

  - Use the connection string from the SAS policy created for your Event Hub
  namespace,

  and the name of the Event Hub instance

  - Use the full namespace like `<yournamespace>.servicebus.windows.net`, and a
  credentials object.


  Optionally, you can also pass an options bag to configure the retry policy or
  proxy settings.

      Creates an instance of `EventDataBatch` to which one can add events until
      the maximum supported size is reached.

      The batch can be passed to the
      <xref:@azure/event-hubs.EventHubProducerClient.sendBatch> method of the
      `EventHubProducerClient` to be sent to Azure Event Hubs.

      Events with different values for partitionKey or partitionId will need to
      be put into different batches.

      To simplify such batch management across partitions or to have the client
      automatically batch events

      and send them in specific intervals, use `EventHubBufferedProducerClient`
      instead.


      The below example assumes you have an array of events at hand to be
      batched safely.

      If you have events coming in one by one, `EventHubBufferedProducerClient`
      is recommended instead

      for effecient management of batches.


      Example usage:

      ```ts

      const client = new EventHubProducerClient(connectionString);

      let batch = await client.createBatch();

      for (let i = 0; i < messages.length; i++) {
       if (!batch.tryAdd(messages[i])) {
         await client.sendBatch(batch);
         batch = await client.createBatch();
         if (!batch.tryAdd(messages[i])) {
           throw new Error("Message too big to fit")
         }
         if (i === messages.length - 1) {
           await client.sendBatch(batch);
         }

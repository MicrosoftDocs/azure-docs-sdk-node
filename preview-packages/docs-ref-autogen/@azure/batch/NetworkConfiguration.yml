      networking enables single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to a VM, which
      may lead to improved networking performance. For more details, see:

    summary: >-
      The ARM resource identifier of the virtual network subnet which the
      Compute Nodes of the Pool will join. This is of the form
      /subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/{group}/providers/{provider}/virtualNetworks/{network}/subnets/{subnet}.
      The virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as the
      Azure Batch Account. The specified subnet should have enough free IP
      addresses to accommodate the number of Compute Nodes in the Pool. If the
      subnet doesn't have enough free IP addresses, the Pool will partially
      allocate Nodes and a resize error will occur. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch'
      service principal must have the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor'
      Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) role for the specified VNet. The
      specified subnet must allow communication from the Azure Batch service to
      be able to schedule Tasks on the Nodes. This can be verified by checking
      if the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG). If
      communication to the Nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG,
      then the Batch service will set the state of the Compute Nodes to
      unusable. Only ARM virtual networks ('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks')
      are supported. If the specified VNet has any associated Network Security
      Groups (NSG), then a few reserved system ports must be enabled for inbound
      communication, including ports 29876 and 29877. Also enable outbound
      connections to Azure Storage on port 443. For more details see:

      Enables you to query for the resource/meter metadata and related prices
      used in a given subscription

      by Offer ID, Currency, Locale and Region. The metadata associated with the
      billing meters, including

      but not limited to service names, types, resources, units of measure, and
      regions, is subject to

      change at any time and without notice. If you intend to use this billing
      data in an automated

      fashion, please use the billing meter GUID to uniquely identify each
      billable item. If the billing

      meter GUID is scheduled to change due to a new billing model, you will be
      notified in advance of the

      change.

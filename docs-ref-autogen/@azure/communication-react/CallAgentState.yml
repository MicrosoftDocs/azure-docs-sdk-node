  State only version of <xref:@azure/communication-calling#CallAgent> except
  calls is moved to be a child directly of

  [CallClientState](xref:@azure/communication-react.CallClientState) and not
  included here. The reason to have CallAgent's state proxied is to provide
  access to

  displayName. We don't flatten CallAgent.displayName and put it in
  CallClientState because it would be ambiguious that

  displayName is actually reliant on the creation/existence of CallAgent to be
  available.

      Uploads a browser Blob object to an Azure file. Requires a blobFactory as
      the data source,

      which need to return a Blob object with the offset and size provided.

      Creates a new Azure File or replaces an existing Azure File, and then
      uploads a Node.js Readable stream into it.

      This method will try to create an Azure File, then starts uploading chunk
      by chunk.

      Size of chunk is defined by `bufferSize` parameter.

      Please make sure potential size of stream doesn't exceed file size.


      PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT TIPS:

      * Input stream highWaterMark is better to set a same value with bufferSize
        parameter, which will avoid Buffer.concat() operations.

  **rapid**: Automatically upgrade the cluster to the latest supported patch
  release on the latest supported minor version. In cases where the cluster is
  at a version of Kubernetes that is at an N-2 minor version where N is the
  latest supported minor version, the cluster first upgrades to the latest
  supported patch version on N-1 minor version. For example, if a cluster is
  running version 1.17.7 and versions 1.17.9, 1.18.4, 1.18.6, and 1.19.1 are
  available, your cluster first is upgraded to 1.18.6, then is upgraded to
  1.19.1. \

  **stable**: Automatically upgrade the cluster to the latest supported patch
  release on minor version N-1, where N is the latest supported minor version.
  For example, if a cluster is running version 1.17.7 and versions 1.17.9,
  1.18.4, 1.18.6, and 1.19.1 are available, your cluster is upgraded to 1.18.6.
  \

  **patch**: Automatically upgrade the cluster to the latest supported patch
  version when it becomes available while keeping the minor version the same.
  For example, if a cluster is running version 1.17.7 and versions 1.17.9,
  1.18.4, 1.18.6, and 1.19.1 are available, your cluster is upgraded to 1.17.9.
  \

  **node-image**: Automatically upgrade the node image to the latest version
  available. Consider using nodeOSUpgradeChannel instead as that allows you to
  configure node OS patching separate from Kubernetes version patching \

  **none**: Disables auto-upgrades and keeps the cluster at its current version
  of Kubernetes.

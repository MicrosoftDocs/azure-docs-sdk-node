      desc to indicate descending. The default is ascending order. Ties will be
      broken by the match

      scores of documents. If no $orderby is specified, the default sort order
      is descending by

      document match score. There can be at most 32 $orderby clauses.

    summary: >-
      A value indicating whether to use fuzzy matching for the suggestion query.
      Default is false.

      When set to true, the query will find suggestions even if there's a
      substituted or missing

      character in the search text. While this provides a better experience in
      some scenarios, it

      comes at a performance cost as fuzzy suggestion searches are slower and
      consume more

      resources.

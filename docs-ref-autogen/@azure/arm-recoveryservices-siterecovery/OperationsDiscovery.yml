      Name of the API. The name of the operation being performed on this
      particular object. It should match the action name that appears in RBAC /
      the event service. Examples of operations include: *
      Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachine/capture/action *
      Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachine/restart/action *
      Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachine/write *
      Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachine/read *
      Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachine/delete Each action should include, in
      order: (1) Resource Provider Namespace (2) Type hierarchy for which the
      action applies (e.g. server/databases for a SQL Azure database) (3) Read,
      Write, Action or Delete indicating which type applies. If it is a
      PUT/PATCH on a collection or named value, Write should be used. If it is a
      GET, Read should be used. If it is a DELETE, Delete should be used. If it
      is a POST, Action should be used. As a note: all resource providers would
      need to include the "{Resource Provider Namespace}/register/action"
      operation in their response. This API is used to register for their
      service, and should include details about the operation (e.g. a localized
      name for the resource provider + any special considerations like PII
      release).

    summary: >-
      Strictly disallows connected group members from having overlapping IP
      address space. Prevents the addition of a virtual network with overlapping
      address to the connected group, blocks peering between a virtual network
      and a connected group member if any connected group member has an
      overlapping range, and restricts address space modifications that would
      introduce overlap.

      Recurrence end model. You can specify the end either by providing a
      numberOfOccurrences (which will end the recurrence after the specified
      number of occurrences) or by providing an endDateTime (which will end the
      recurrence after the specified date). If neither value is provided, the
      recurrence will continue until it is manually ended. However, if both
      values are provided, an error will be thrown.

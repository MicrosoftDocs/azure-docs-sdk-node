  - name: BernoulliNaiveBayes
    uid: '@azure/arm-machinelearning.KnownClassificationModels.BernoulliNaiveBayes'
    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'
    summary: Naive Bayes classifier for multivariate Bernoulli models.
  - name: DecisionTree
    uid: '@azure/arm-machinelearning.KnownClassificationModels.DecisionTree'
    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'
    summary: >-
      Decision Trees are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for
      both classification and regression tasks.

      The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable
      by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.
  - name: ExtremeRandomTrees
    uid: '@azure/arm-machinelearning.KnownClassificationModels.ExtremeRandomTrees'
    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'
    summary: >-
      Extreme Trees is an ensemble machine learning algorithm that combines the
      predictions from many decision trees. It is related to the widely used
      random forest algorithm.
  - name: GradientBoosting
    uid: '@azure/arm-machinelearning.KnownClassificationModels.GradientBoosting'
    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'
    summary: >-
      The technique of transiting week learners into a strong learner is called
      Boosting. The gradient boosting algorithm process works on this theory of
      execution.
  - name: KNN
    uid: '@azure/arm-machinelearning.KnownClassificationModels.KNN'
    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'
    summary: >-
      K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm uses 'feature similarity' to predict
      the values of new datapoints

      which further means that the new data point will be assigned a value based
      on how closely it matches the points in the training set.
  - name: LightGBM
    uid: '@azure/arm-machinelearning.KnownClassificationModels.LightGBM'
    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'
    summary: >-
      LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree based learning
      algorithms.
  - name: LinearSVM
    uid: '@azure/arm-machinelearning.KnownClassificationModels.LinearSVM'
    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'
    summary: >-
      A support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning model that
      uses classification algorithms for two-group classification problems.

      After giving an SVM model sets of labeled training data for each category,
      they're able to categorize new text.

      Linear SVM performs best when input data is linear, i.e., data can be
      easily classified by drawing the straight line between classified values
      on a plotted graph.
  - name: LogisticRegression
    uid: '@azure/arm-machinelearning.KnownClassificationModels.LogisticRegression'
    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'
    summary: >-
      Logistic regression is a fundamental classification technique.

      It belongs to the group of linear classifiers and is somewhat similar to
      polynomial and linear regression.

      Logistic regression is fast and relatively uncomplicated, and it's
      convenient for you to interpret the results.

      Although it's essentially a method for binary classification, it can also
      be applied to multiclass problems.
  - name: MultinomialNaiveBayes
    uid: '@azure/arm-machinelearning.KnownClassificationModels.MultinomialNaiveBayes'
    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'
    summary: >-
      The multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is suitable for classification with
      discrete features (e.g., word counts for text classification).

      The multinomial distribution normally requires integer feature counts.
      However, in practice, fractional counts such as tf-idf may also work.
  - name: RandomForest
    uid: '@azure/arm-machinelearning.KnownClassificationModels.RandomForest'
    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'
    summary: >-
      Random forest is a supervised learning algorithm.

      The "forest" it builds, is an ensemble of decision trees, usually trained
      with the “bagging” method.

      The general idea of the bagging method is that a combination of learning
      models increases the overall result.
  - name: SGD
    uid: '@azure/arm-machinelearning.KnownClassificationModels.SGD'
    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'
    summary: >-
      SGD: Stochastic gradient descent is an optimization algorithm often used
      in machine learning applications

      to find the model parameters that correspond to the best fit between
      predicted and actual outputs.
  - name: SVM
    uid: '@azure/arm-machinelearning.KnownClassificationModels.SVM'
    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'
    summary: >-
      A support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning model that
      uses classification algorithms for two-group classification problems.

      After giving an SVM model sets of labeled training data for each category,
      they're able to categorize new text.

    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'
    summary: >-
      XGBoost: Extreme Gradient Boosting Algorithm. This algorithm is used for
      structured data where target column values can be divided into distinct
      class values.

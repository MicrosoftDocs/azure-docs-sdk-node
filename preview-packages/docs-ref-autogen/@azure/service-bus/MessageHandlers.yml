      Handler that processes errors that occur during receiving.


      This handler will be called for any error that occurs in the receiver when
        - receiving the message, or
        - executing your `processMessage` callback, or
        - receiver is completing the message on your behalf after successfully running your `processMessage` callback and `autoCompleteMessages` is enabled
        - receiver is abandoning the message on your behalf if running your `processMessage` callback fails and `autoCompleteMessages` is enabled
        - receiver is renewing the lock on your behalf due to auto lock renewal feature being enabled

      Note that when receiving messages in a stream using `subscribe()`, the
      receiver will automatically retry receiving messages on all errors unless

      `close()` is called on the subscription. It is completely up to users to
      decide what errors are considered non-recoverable and to handle them

      accordingly in this callback.

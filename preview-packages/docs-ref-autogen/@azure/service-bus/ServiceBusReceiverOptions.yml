      Represents the receive mode for the receiver.

      In receiveAndDelete mode, messages are deleted from Service Bus as they
      are received.


      In peekLock mode, the receiver has a lock on the message for the duration
      specified on the

      queue/subscription.


      Messages that are not settled within the lock duration will be redelivered
      as many times as

      the max delivery count set on the queue/subscription, after which they get
      sent to a separate

      dead letter queue.


      You can settle a message by calling complete(), abandon(), defer() or
      deadletter() methods on

      the message.

      prefer to work directly with the bytes present in the message body than
      have the client attempt to parse it.

      The WAN-link upload bandwidth (maximum data transfer rate) in megabits per
      second. Value of 0 indicates no throughput is allowed and any running
      migration job is effectively paused for the duration of this recurrence.
      Only data plane operations are governed by this limit. Control plane
      operations ensure seamless functionality. The agent may exceed this limit
      with control messages, if necessary.

            order of preference. For additional information, including expected
            format,

            see
            [RFC2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html).
            This

            header and the setLang query parameter are mutually exclusive; do
            not

            specify both. If you set this header, you must also specify the cc
            query

            parameter. Bing will use the first supported language it finds from
            the

            list, and combine that language with the cc parameter value to
            determine the

            market to return results for. If the list does not include a
            supported

            language, Bing will find the closest language and market that
            supports the

            request, and may use an aggregated or default market for the results
            instead

            of a specified one. You should use this header and the cc query
            parameter

            only if you specify multiple languages; otherwise, you should use
            the mkt

            and setLang query parameters. A user interface string is a string
            that's

            used as a label in a user interface. There are very few user
            interface

            strings in the JSON response objects. Any links in the response
            objects to

            Bing.com properties will apply the specified language.

            Bing uses the user agent to provide mobile users with an optimized

            experience. Although optional, you are strongly encouraged to always
            specify

            this header. The user-agent should be the same string that any
            commonly used

            browser would send. For information about user agents, see [RFC

            2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html).

          description: >-
            Bing uses this header to provide users

            with consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights
            new

            features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for
            assigning

            traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID
            for a

            user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user to
            multiple

            conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights
            can lead

            to an inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second
            request has a

            different flight assignment than the first, the experience may be

            unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results
            to that

            client ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the
            user. Bing

            also uses this header to help improve result rankings by analyzing
            the

            activity generated by a client ID. The relevance improvements help
            with

            better quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables
            higher

            click-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although
            optional, you

            should consider this header required. Persisting the client ID
            across

            multiple requests for the same end user and device combination
            enables 1)

            the API consumer to receive a consistent user experience, and 2)
            higher

            click-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing
            APIs. Each

            user that uses your application on the device must have a unique,
            Bing

            generated client ID. If you do not include this header in the
            request, Bing

            generates an ID and returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response
            header. The

            only time that you should NOT include this header in a request is
            the first

            time the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for
            each Bing

            API request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist
            the

            client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP
            cookie

            to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session
            cookie.

            For other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent
            storage to

            persist the ID. The next time the user uses your app on that device,
            get the

            client ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include
            this

            header. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID
            and use

            it for all subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If
            you

            include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the
            request.

            uses

            the location information to determine safe search behavior. Although

            optional, you are encouraged to always specify this header and the

            X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for example,
            by

            changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address results in
            the

            location not being anywhere near the device's actual location, which
            may

            result in Bing serving erroneous results.

            A semicolon-delimited list of key/value

            pairs that describe the client's geographical location. Bing uses
            the

            location information to determine safe search behavior and to return

            relevant local content. Specify the key/value pair as <key>:<value>.
            The

            following are the keys that you use to specify the user's location.
            lat

            (required): The latitude of the client's location, in degrees. The
            latitude

            must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to
            +90.0.

            Negative values indicate southern latitudes and positive values
            indicate

            northern latitudes. long (required): The longitude of the client's
            location,

            in degrees. The longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0
            and less

            than or equal to +180.0. Negative values indicate western longitudes
            and

            positive values indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The
            radius, in

            meters, which specifies the horizontal accuracy of the coordinates.
            Pass the

            value returned by the device's location service. Typical values
            might be 22m

            for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for
            reverse IP

            lookup. ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was
            at the

            location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January
            1,

            1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading or direction
            of

            travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through
            360,

            counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only if
            the sp

            key is nonzero. sp (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in
            meters

            per second, that the client device is traveling. alt (optional): The

            altitude of the client device, in meters. are (optional): The
            radius, in

            meters, that specifies the vertical accuracy of the coordinates.
            Specify

            this key only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the keys
            are

            optional, the more information that you provide, the more accurate
            the

            location results are. Although optional, you are encouraged to
            always

            specify the user's geographical location. Providing the location is

            especially important if the client's IP address does not accurately
            reflect

            the user's physical location (for example, if the client uses VPN).
            For

            optimal results, you should include this header and the
            X-MSEdge-ClientIP

            header, but at a minimum, you should include this header.
          optional: true

            relatedSearches

            for a request and you set this parameter to two (2), the response
            includes

            parameter in

            the same request and set it to webpages and news, the response would
            include

            to us. If

            you set this parameter, you must also specify the Accept-Language
            header.

            Bing uses the first supported language it finds from the languages
            list, and

            combine that language with the country code that you specify to
            determine

            the market to return results for. If the languages list does not
            include a

            supported language, Bing finds the closest language and market that
            supports

            the request, or it may use an aggregated or default market for the
            results

            instead of a specified one. You should use this query parameter and
            the

            Accept-Language query parameter only if you specify multiple

            Typically, mkt is the country where the user is making the request
            from.

            However, it could be a different country if the user is not located
            in a

            country where Bing delivers results. The market must be in the form

            insensitive. If known, you are encouraged to always specify the

            Specifying the market helps Bing route the request and return an
            appropriate

            and optimal response. If you specify a market that is not listed in
            Market

            Codes, Bing uses a best fit market code based on an internal mapping

            if the ranked answers are news, images, and videos, and you set
            answerCount

            to 1 and promote to news, the response contains news and images. Or,
            if the

            ranked answers are videos, images, and news, the response contains
            videos

            and news. Possible values are Computation, Images, News,
            RelatedSearches,

            SpellSuggestions, TimeZone, Videos, Webpages. Use only if you

            answer, you should instead use the answer-specific endpoint in order

            richer results. For example, to receive only images, send the

            of the Image Search API endpoints. The RelatedSearches and
            SpellSuggestions

            answers do not support a separate endpoint like the Image Search API
            does

            (only the Web Search API returns them). To include answers that
            would

            otherwise be excluded because of ranking, see the promote query

            return webpages with adult text, images, or videos. The default is

            If the request comes from a market that Bing's adult policy requires
            that

            safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing ignores the safeSearch value and
            uses

            Strict. If you use the site: query operator, there is the chance
            that the

            response may contain adult content regardless of what the safeSearch
            query

            parameter is set to. Use site: only if you are aware of the content

            strings. Specify the language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter language
            code.

            For example, the language code for English is EN. The default is EN

            (English). Although optional, you should always specify the
            language.

            Typically, you set setLang to the same language specified by mkt
            unless the

            user wants the user interface strings displayed in a different

            formatting.

            The Unicode characters are in the range E000 through E019. For
            example, Bing

            the

            list, and combine that language with the cc parameter value to

            specify

            this header. The user-agent should be the same string that any
            commonly used

            browser would send. For information about user agents, see [RFC

          description: >-
            Bing uses this header to provide users

            with consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights
            new

            features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for
            assigning

            traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID
            for a

            user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user to
            multiple

            conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights
            can lead

            to an inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second
            request has a

            different flight assignment than the first, the experience may be

            unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results
            to that

            client ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the
            user. Bing

            also uses this header to help improve result rankings by analyzing
            the

            activity generated by a client ID. The relevance improvements help
            with

            better quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables
            higher

            click-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although
            optional, you

            should consider this header required. Persisting the client ID
            across

            multiple requests for the same end user and device combination
            enables 1)

            the API consumer to receive a consistent user experience, and 2)
            higher

            click-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing
            APIs. Each

            user that uses your application on the device must have a unique,
            Bing

            generated client ID. If you do not include this header in the
            request, Bing

            generates an ID and returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response
            header. The

            only time that you should NOT include this header in a request is
            the first

            time the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for
            each Bing

            API request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist
            the

            client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP
            cookie

            to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session
            cookie.

            For other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent
            storage to

            persist the ID. The next time the user uses your app on that device,
            get the

            client ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include
            this

            header. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID
            and use

            it for all subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If
            you

            include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the
            request.

            The

            following are the keys that you use to specify the user's location.
            lat

            (required): The latitude of the client's location, in degrees. The
            latitude

            must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to
            +90.0.

            Negative values indicate southern latitudes and positive values
            indicate

            northern latitudes. long (required): The longitude of the client's
            location,

            in degrees. The longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0
            and less

            than or equal to +180.0. Negative values indicate western longitudes
            and

            positive values indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The
            radius, in

            meters, which specifies the horizontal accuracy of the coordinates.
            Pass the

            value returned by the device's location service. Typical values
            might be 22m

            for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for
            reverse IP

            lookup. ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was
            at the

            location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January
            1,

            1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading or direction
            of

            travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through
            360,

            counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only if
            the sp

            key is nonzero. sp (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in
            meters

            per second, that the client device is traveling. alt (optional): The

            altitude of the client device, in meters. are (optional): The
            radius, in

            meters, that specifies the vertical accuracy of the coordinates.
            Specify

            this key only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the keys
            are

            optional, the more information that you provide, the more accurate
            the

            location results are. Although optional, you are encouraged to

            for a request and you set this parameter to two (2), the response
            includes

            webpages and images.If you included the responseFilter query
            parameter in

            the same request and set it to webpages and news, the response would
            include

            only webpages.
          optional: true
        - id: options.countryCode
          type:
            - string
          description: >-
            A 2-character country code of the

            country where the results come from. This API supports only the
            United

            States market. If you specify this query parameter, it must be set
            to us. If

            you set this parameter, you must also specify the Accept-Language
            header.

            Bing uses the first supported language it finds from the languages
            list, and

            combine that language with the country code that you specify to
            determine

            the market to return results for. If the languages list does not
            include a

            supported language, Bing finds the closest language and market that
            supports

            the request, or it may use an aggregated or default market for the
            results

            instead of a specified one. You should use this query parameter and
            the

            Accept-Language query parameter only if you specify multiple
            languages;

            otherwise, you should use the mkt and setLang query parameters. This

            parameter and the mkt query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not
            specify

            both.
          optional: true
        - id: options.count
          type:
            - number
          description: >-
            The number of search results to return in

            the response. The default is 10 and the maximum value is 50. The
            actual

            number delivered may be less than requested.Use this parameter along
            with

            the offset parameter to page results.For example, if your user
            interface

            displays 10 search results per page, set count to 10 and offset to 0
            to get

            the first page of results. For each subsequent page, increment
            offset by 10

            (for example, 0, 10, 20). It is possible for multiple pages to
            include some

            overlap in results.
          optional: true

            Filter search results by the following

            age values: Day—Return webpages that Bing discovered within the last
            24

            hours. Week—Return webpages that Bing discovered within the last 7
            days.

            Month—Return webpages that discovered within the last 30 days. This
            filter

            applies only to webpage results and not to the other results such as
            news

            and images. Possible values include: 'Day', 'Week', 'Month'
          optional: true
        - id: options.market
          type:
            - string
          description: >-
            The market where the results come from.

            Typically, mkt is the country where the user is making the request
            from.

            However, it could be a different country if the user is not located
            in a

            country where Bing delivers results. The market must be in the form

            <language code>-<country code>. For example, en-US. The string is
            case

            insensitive. If known, you are encouraged to always specify the
            market.

            Specifying the market helps Bing route the request and return an
            appropriate

            and optimal response. If you specify a market that is not listed in
            Market

            Codes, Bing uses a best fit market code based on an internal mapping
            that is

            subject to change. This parameter and the cc query parameter are
            mutually

            exclusive—do not specify both.
          optional: true
        - id: options.offset
          type:
            - number
          description: >-
            The zero-based offset that indicates the

            number of search results to skip before returning results. The
            default is 0.

            The offset should be less than (totalEstimatedMatches - count). Use
            this

            parameter along with the count parameter to page results. For
            example, if

            your user interface displays 10 search results per page, set count
            to 10 and

            offset to 0 to get the first page of results. For each subsequent
            page,

            increment offset by 10 (for example, 0, 10, 20). it is possible for
            multiple

            pages to include some overlap in results.

          description: >-
            A comma-delimited list of answers that you

            want the response to include regardless of their ranking. For
            example, if

            you set answerCount) to two (2) so Bing returns the top two ranked
            answers,

            but you also want the response to include news, you'd set promote to
            news.

            If the top ranked answers are webpages, images, videos, and
            relatedSearches,

            the response includes webpages and images because news is not a
            ranked

            answer. But if you set promote to video, Bing would promote the
            video answer

            into the response and return webpages, images, and videos. The
            answers that

            you want to promote do not count against the answerCount limit. For
            example,

            if the ranked answers are news, images, and videos, and you set
            answerCount

            to 1 and promote to news, the response contains news and images. Or,
            if the

            ranked answers are videos, images, and news, the response contains
            videos

            and news. Possible values are Computation, Images, News,
            RelatedSearches,

            SpellSuggestions, TimeZone, Videos, Webpages. Use only if you
            specify

            answerCount.

            A comma-delimited list of answers to

            include in the response. If you do not specify this parameter, the
            response

            includes all search answers for which there's relevant data.
            Possible filter

            values are Computation, Images, News, RelatedSearches,
            SpellSuggestions,

            TimeZone, Videos, Webpages. Although you may use this filter to get
            a single

            answer, you should instead use the answer-specific endpoint in order
            to get

            richer results. For example, to receive only images, send the
            request to one

            of the Image Search API endpoints. The RelatedSearches and
            SpellSuggestions

            answers do not support a separate endpoint like the Image Search API
            does

            (only the Web Search API returns them). To include answers that
            would

            otherwise be excluded because of ranking, see the promote query
            parameter.
          optional: true

            A filter used to filter adult content.

            Off: Return webpages with adult text, images, or videos. Moderate:
            Return

            webpages with adult text, but not adult images or videos. Strict: Do
            not

            return webpages with adult text, images, or videos. The default is
            Moderate.

            If the request comes from a market that Bing's adult policy requires
            that

            safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing ignores the safeSearch value and
            uses

            Strict. If you use the site: query operator, there is the chance
            that the

            response may contain adult content regardless of what the safeSearch
            query

            parameter is set to. Use site: only if you are aware of the content
            on the

            site and your scenario supports the possibility of adult content.
            Possible

            strings. Specify the language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter language
            code.

            For example, the language code for English is EN. The default is EN

            (English). Although optional, you should always specify the
            language.

            Typically, you set setLang to the same language specified by mkt
            unless the

            user wants the user interface strings displayed in a different
            language.

            This parameter and the Accept-Language header are mutually
            exclusive; do not

            specify both. A user interface string is a string that's used as a
            label in

            a user interface. There are few user interface strings in the JSON
            response

            formatting.

            The Unicode characters are in the range E000 through E019. For
            example, Bing

            uses E000 and E001 to mark the beginning and end of query terms for
            hit

      This property can only be changed for disabled and unlocked time-based
      retention policies. When enabled, new blocks can be written to an append
      blob while maintaining immutability protection and compliance. Only new
      blocks can be added and any existing blocks cannot be modified or deleted.

      The ImmutabilityPolicy state defines the mode of the policy. Disabled
      state disables the policy, Unlocked state allows increase and decrease of
      immutability retention time and also allows toggling
      allowProtectedAppendWrites property, Locked state only allows the increase
      of the immutability retention time. A policy can only be created in a
      Disabled or Unlocked state and can be toggled between the two states. Only
      a policy in an Unlocked state can transition to a Locked state which
      cannot be reverted.

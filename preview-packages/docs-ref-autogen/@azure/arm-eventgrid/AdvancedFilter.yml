summary: >-
  This is the base type that represents an advanced filter. To configure an
  advanced filter, do not directly instantiate an object of this class. Instead,
  instantiate an object of a derived class such as BoolEqualsAdvancedFilter,
  NumberInAdvancedFilter, StringEqualsAdvancedFilter etc. depending on the type
  of the key based on which you want to filter.

      Degraded threshold for aggregating the propagated health state of child
      dependencies. Can be either an absolute number that is greater than 0, or
      a percentage between 1-100%. The entity will be considered degraded when
      the number of not healthy child dependents (unhealthy, degraded, unknown)
      is equal to or above the threshold value. Must only be set when
      AggregationType is 'Thresholds'.

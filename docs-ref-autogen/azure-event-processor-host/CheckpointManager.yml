      Creates the checkpoint HOLDERs for the given partitions. Does nothing for
      any checkpoint

      HOLDERs that already exist.

      The semantics of this are complicated because it is possible to use the
      same store for both

      leases and checkpoints (the Azure Storage implementation does so) and it
      is required to

      have a lease for every partition but it is not required to have a
      checkpoint for a partition.

      It is a valid scenario to never use checkpoints at all, so it is important
      for the store to

      distinguish between creating the structure(s) that will hold a checkpoint
      and actually creating

      a checkpoint (storing an offset/sequence number pair in the structure).

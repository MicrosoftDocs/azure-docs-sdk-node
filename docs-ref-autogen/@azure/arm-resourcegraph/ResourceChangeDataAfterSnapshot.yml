      The time when the snapshot was created.

      The snapshot timestamp provides an approximation as to when a modification
      to a resource was

      detected.  There can be a difference between the actual modification time
      and the detection

      time.  This is due to differences in how operations that modify a resource
      are processed,

      versus how operation that record resource snapshots are processed.

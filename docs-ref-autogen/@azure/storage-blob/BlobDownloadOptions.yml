      How many retries will perform when original body download stream
      unexpected ends.

      Above kind of ends will not trigger retry policy defined in a pipeline,

      because they doesn't emit network errors.


      With this option, every additional retry means an additional
      `FileClient.download()` request will be made

      from the broken point, until the requested range has been successfully
      downloaded or maxRetryRequests is reached.


      Default value is 5, please set a larger value when loading large files in
      poor network.

    summary: >-
      Aligned affinity ensures that the primaries of the partitions of the
      affinitized services are collocated on the same nodes. This is the default
      and is the same as selecting the Affinity scheme. The value is 0.
  - name: NonAlignedAffinity
    uid: >-
      @azure/arm-servicefabricmanagedclusters.KnownServiceCorrelationScheme.NonAlignedAffinity
    package: '@azure/arm-servicefabricmanagedclusters'
    summary: >-
      Non-Aligned affinity guarantees that all replicas of each service will be
      placed on the same nodes. Unlike Aligned Affinity, this does not guarantee
      that replicas of particular role will be collocated. The value is 1.

    summary: >
      The property of the health information. An entity can have health reports
      for different

      properties.

      The property is a string and not a fixed enumeration to allow the reporter
      flexibility to

      categorize the state condition that triggers the report.

      For example, a reporter with SourceId "LocalWatchdog" can monitor the
      state of the available

      disk on a node,

      so it can report "AvailableDisk" property on that node.

      The same reporter can monitor the node connectivity, so it can report a
      property

      "Connectivity" on the same node.

      In the health store, these reports are treated as separate health events
      for the specified

      node.

      Together with the SourceId, the property uniquely identifies the health
      information.

      Value that indicates whether the report is removed from health store when
      it expires.

      If set to true, the report is removed from the health store after it
      expires.

      If set to false, the report is treated as an error when expired. The value
      of this property is

      false by default.

      When clients report periodically, they should set RemoveWhenExpired false
      (default).

      This way, if the reporter has issues (e.g. deadlock) and can't report, the
      entity is evaluated

      at error when the health report expires.

      This flags the entity as being in Error health state.

      frequency than time to

      live.

      If clients report on transition, they can set the time to live to
      infinite.

      When time to live expires, the health event that contains the health
      information

      is either removed from health store, if RemoveWhenExpired is true, or

      RemoveWhenExpired false.

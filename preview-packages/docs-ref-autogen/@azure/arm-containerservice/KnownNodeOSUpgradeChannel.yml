      AKS will update the nodes with a newly patched VHD containing security
      fixes and bugfixes on a weekly cadence. With the VHD update machines will
      be rolling reimaged to that VHD following maintenance windows and surge
      settings. No extra VHD cost is incurred when choosing this option as AKS
      hosts the images.

      No attempt to update your machines OS will be made either by OS or by
      rolling VHDs. This means you are responsible for your security updates

    package: '@azure/arm-containerservice'
    summary: >-
      AKS will update the nodes VHD with patches from the image maintainer
      labelled "security only" on a regular basis. Where possible, patches will
      also be applied without reimaging to existing nodes. Some patches, such as
      kernel patches, cannot be applied to existing nodes without disruption.
      For such patches, the VHD will be updated, and machines will be rolling
      reimaged to that VHD following maintenance windows and surge settings.
      This option incurs the extra cost of hosting the VHDs in your node
      resource group.

    summary: >-
      OS updates will be applied automatically through the OS built-in patching
      infrastructure. Newly scaled in machines will be unpatched initially, and
      will be patched at some later time by the OS's infrastructure. Behavior of
      this option depends on the OS in question. Ubuntu and Mariner apply
      security patches through unattended upgrade roughly once a day around
      06:00 UTC. Windows does not apply security patches automatically and so
      for them this option is equivalent to None till further notice

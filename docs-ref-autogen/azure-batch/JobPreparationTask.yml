    summary: "A Job Preparation task to run before any tasks of the job on any\rgiven compute node.\r\rYou can use Job Preparation to prepare a compute node to run tasks for the\rjob. Activities commonly performed in Job Preparation include: Downloading\rcommon resource files used by all the tasks in the job. The Job Preparation\rtask can download these common resource files to the shared location on the\rcompute node. (AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR\\shared), or starting a local service\ron the compute node so that all tasks of that job can communicate with it.\rIf the Job Preparation task fails (that is, exhausts its retry count before\rexiting with exit code 0), Batch will not run tasks of this job on the\rcompute node. The node remains ineligible to run tasks of this job until it\ris reimaged. The node remains active and can be used for other jobs. The Job\rPreparation task can run multiple times on the same compute node. Therefore,\ryou should write the Job Preparation task to handle re-execution. If the\rcompute node is rebooted, the Job Preparation task is run again on the node\rbefore scheduling any other task of the job, if\rrerunOnNodeRebootAfterSuccess is true or if the Job Preparation task did not\rpreviously complete. If the compute node is reimaged, the Job Preparation\rtask is run again before scheduling any task of the job."

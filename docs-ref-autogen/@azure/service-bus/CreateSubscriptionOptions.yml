      a subscription’s filter evaluation. If the value is set to true, the

      caused the exception will be moved to the subscription’s dead-letter

      Otherwise, it will be discarded. By default this parameter is set to true,

      allowing the user a chance to investigate the cause of the exception.

      It can occur from a malformed message or some incorrect assumptions being
      made

      in the filter about the form of the message. Settable only at topic
      creation time.

  A process resource represents a process running on a machine. The process may
  be actively *monitored*, i.e., a Dependency Agent is running on its machine,
  or *discovered*, i.e., its existence was inferred by observing the data stream
  from monitored machines. A process resource represents a pool of actual
  operating system resources that share command lines and metadata. As the
  process pool evolves over time, prior versions of the process resource are
  preserved and available for access. A process is live during an interval of
  time, if that process is executing during (parts) of that interval

      Enable buffering additional items during queries. Default: false


      This will buffer an additional page at a time (multiplied by
      maxDegreeOfParallelism) from the server in the background.

      This improves latency by fetching pages before they are needed by the
      client. If you're draining all of the results from the

      server, like `.fetchAll`, you should usually enable this. If you're only
      fetching one page at a time via continuation token,

      you should avoid this. If you're draining more than one page, but not the
      entire result set, it may help improve latency, but

      it will increase the total amount of RU/s use to serve the entire query
      (as some pages will be fetched more than once).

      Continuation Tokens contain optional data that can be removed from the
      serialization before writing it out to a header.

      By default we are capping this to 1kb to avoid long headers (Node.js has a
      global header size limit).

      A user may set this field to allow for longer headers, which can help the
      backend optimize query execution."

      This setting forces the query to use a query plan. Default: false


      Note: this will disable continuation token support, even for single
      partition queries.


      For queries like aggregates and most cross partition queries, this happens
      anyway.

      However, since the library doesn't know what type of query it is until we
      get back the first response,

      some optimization can't happen until later.


      If this setting is enabled, it will force query plan for the query, which
      will save some network requests

      and ensure parallelism can happen. Useful for when you know you're doing
      cross-partition or aggregate queries.

      Expirimenting with this value can usually result in the biggest

      The smaller the item count, the faster the first result will be delivered
      (for non-aggregates). For larger amounts,

      it will take longer to serve the request, but you'll usually get better
      throughput for large queries (i.e. if you need 1000 items

      before you can do any other actions, set `maxItemCount` to 1000. If you
      can start doing work after the first 100, set `maxItemCount` to 100.)

      Limits the query to a specific partition key. Default: undefined

       Scoping a query to a single partition can be accomplished two ways:

      }).toArray()`

      `container.items.query('SELECT * from c WHERE c.yourPartitionKey =
      "foo"').toArray()`


      The former is useful when the query body is out of your control

      but you still want to restrict it to a single partition. Example: an end
      user specified query.

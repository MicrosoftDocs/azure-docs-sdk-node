  - name: ComputeOptimized
    uid: '@azure/arm-computebulkactions.KnownVMCategory.ComputeOptimized'
    package: '@azure/arm-computebulkactions'
    summary: >-
      Compute optimized VM sizes have a high CPU-to-memory ratio. These sizes
      are good for medium traffic web servers, network appliances, batch
      processes, and application servers.
  - name: FpgaAccelerated
    uid: '@azure/arm-computebulkactions.KnownVMCategory.FpgaAccelerated'
    package: '@azure/arm-computebulkactions'
    summary: >-
      FPGA optimized VM sizes are specialized virtual machines available with
      single or multiple FPGA.
          These sizes are designed for compute-intensive workloads. This article provides information about the number and type of FPGA, vCPUs, data disks, and NICs.
          Storage throughput and network bandwidth are also included for each size in this grouping.
  - name: GeneralPurpose
    uid: '@azure/arm-computebulkactions.KnownVMCategory.GeneralPurpose'
    package: '@azure/arm-computebulkactions'
    summary: >-
      General purpose VM sizes provide balanced CPU-to-memory ratio. Ideal for
      testing and development, small to medium databases, and low to medium
      traffic web servers.
  - name: GpuAccelerated
    uid: '@azure/arm-computebulkactions.KnownVMCategory.GpuAccelerated'
    package: '@azure/arm-computebulkactions'
    summary: >-
      GPU optimized VM sizes are specialized virtual machines available with
      single, multiple, or fractional GPUs.
          These sizes are designed for compute-intensive, graphics-intensive, and visualization workloads.
  - name: HighPerformanceCompute
    uid: '@azure/arm-computebulkactions.KnownVMCategory.HighPerformanceCompute'
    package: '@azure/arm-computebulkactions'
    summary: >-
      Azure High Performance Compute VMs are optimized for various HPC workloads
      such as computational fluid dynamics, finite element analysis, frontend
      and backend EDA,
          rendering, molecular dynamics, computational geo science, weather simulation, and financial risk analysis.
  - name: MemoryOptimized
    uid: '@azure/arm-computebulkactions.KnownVMCategory.MemoryOptimized'
    package: '@azure/arm-computebulkactions'
    summary: >-
      Memory optimized VM sizes offer a high memory-to-CPU ratio that is great
      for relational database servers, medium to large caches, and in-memory
      analytics.
  - name: StorageOptimized
    uid: '@azure/arm-computebulkactions.KnownVMCategory.StorageOptimized'
    package: '@azure/arm-computebulkactions'
    summary: >-
      Storage optimized virtual machine (VM) sizes offer high disk throughput
      and IO, and are ideal for Big Data, SQL, NoSQL databases, data
      warehousing, and large transactional databases.
          Examples include Cassandra, MongoDB, Cloudera, and Redis.

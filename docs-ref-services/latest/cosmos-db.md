# Azure Cosmos DB Modules for JavaScript

Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoft's globally distributed, multi-model database. Azure Cosmos DB enables you to elastically and independently scale throughput and storage across any number of Azure's geographic regions. It offers throughput, latency, availability, and consistency guarantees with comprehensive service level agreements (SLAs), something no other database service can offer.

Azure Cosmos DB contains a write optimized, resource governed, schema-agnostic database engine that natively supports multiple data models: key-value, documents, graphs, and columnar. It also supports many APIs for accessing data including MongoDB, SQL, Gremlin/Graph, Azure Tables, and Cassandra (preview) in an extensible manner.

## Management Package

### Install the npm module 

Install the Azure Cosmos DB npm module.

```bash
npm install @azure/arm-cosmosdb
```

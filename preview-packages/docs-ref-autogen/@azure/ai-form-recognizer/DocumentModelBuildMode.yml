  Supported model build modes. The model build mode selects the engine that the
  service uses to train the model based

  on the labeled training data.


  The options are:

  - "neural", which yields the highest quality of model that is capable of
  extracting data from classes of documents
    that have the same structure of data, but different layouts (for example, W2 tax forms, which may vary from company
    to company, but always contain the same information).
  - "template", which requires all documents to have the same fixed layout
  (template).

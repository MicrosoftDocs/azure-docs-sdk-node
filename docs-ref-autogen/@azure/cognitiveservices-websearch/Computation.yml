      The math or conversion expression. If the query contains a request to
      convert units of measure

      (for example, meters to feet), this field contains the from units and
      value contains the to

      units. If the query contains a mathematical expression such as 2+2, this
      field contains the

      expression and value contains the answer. Note that mathematical
      expressions may be

      normalized. For example, if the query was sqrt(4^2+8^2), the normalized
      expression may be

      sqrt((4^2)+(8^2)). If the user's query is a math question and the
      textDecorations query

      parameter is set to true, the expression string may include formatting
      markers. For example,

      if the user's query is log(2), the normalized expression includes the
      subscript markers. For

      more information, see Hit Highlighting.

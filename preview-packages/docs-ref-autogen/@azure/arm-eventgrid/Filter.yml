summary: >-
  This is the base type that represents a filter. To configure a filter, do not
  directly instantiate an object of this class. Instead, instantiate

  an object of a derived class such as BoolEqualsFilter, NumberInFilter,
  StringEqualsFilter etc depending on the type of the key based on

  which you want to filter.

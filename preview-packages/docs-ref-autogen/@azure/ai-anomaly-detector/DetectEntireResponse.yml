      LowerMargins contain lower margin of each input point. LowerMargin is used

      normal ones in client side. The index of the array is consistent with the

      UpperMargins contain upper margin of each input point. UpperMargin is used
      to calculate upperBoundary, which equals to expectedValue + (100 -
      marginScale)*upperMargin. Anomalies in response can be filtered by
      upperBoundary and lowerBoundary. By adjusting marginScale value, less
      significant anomalies can be filtered in client side. The index of the

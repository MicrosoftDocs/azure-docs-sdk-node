    summary: "Network Mapping model. Ideally it should have been possible to inherit this\rclass from prev version in InheritedModels as long as there is no difference\rin structure or method signature. Since there were no base Models for\rcertain fields and methods viz NetworkMappingProperties and Load with\rrequired return type, the class has been introduced in its entirety with\rreferences to base models to facilitate exensions in subsequent versions."

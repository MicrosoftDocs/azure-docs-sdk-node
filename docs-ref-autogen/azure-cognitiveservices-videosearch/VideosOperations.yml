          description: "Bing uses this header to provide users\rwith consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new\rfeatures and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning\rtraffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a\ruser across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user to multiple\rconflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead\rto an inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second request has a\rdifferent flight assignment than the first, the experience may be\runexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that\rclient ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing\ralso uses this header to help improve result rankings by analyzing the\ractivity generated by a client ID. The relevance improvements help with\rbetter quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher\rclick-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you\rshould consider this header required. Persisting the client ID across\rmultiple requests for the same end user and device combination enables 1)\rthe API consumer to receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher\rclick-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each\ruser that uses your application on the device must have a unique, Bing\rgenerated client ID. If you do not include this header in the request, Bing\rgenerates an ID and returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The\ronly time that you should NOT include this header in a request is the first\rtime the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing\rAPI request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the\rclient ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie\rto ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie.\rFor other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to\rpersist the ID. The next time the user uses your app on that device, get the\rclient ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this\rheader. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use\rit for all subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If you\rinclude the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request."

Specify\rthis key only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are\roptional, the more information that you provide, the more accurate the\rlocation results are. Although optional, you are encouraged to always\rspecify the user's geographical location. Providing the location is\respecially important if the client's IP address does not accurately reflect\rthe user's physical location (for example, if the client uses VPN).

Bing often flights new\rfeatures and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning\rtraffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a\ruser across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user to multiple\rconflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead\rto an inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second request has a\rdifferent flight assignment than the first, the experience may be\runexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that\rclient ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing\ralso uses this header to help improve result rankings by analyzing the\ractivity generated by a client ID. The relevance improvements help with\rbetter quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher\rclick-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you\rshould consider this header required. Persisting the client ID across\rmultiple requests for the same end user and device combination enables 1)\rthe API consumer to receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher\rclick-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each\ruser that uses your application on the device must have a unique, Bing\rgenerated client ID. If you do not include this header in the request, Bing\rgenerates an ID and returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The\ronly time that you should NOT include this header in a request is the first\rtime the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing\rAPI request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the\rclient ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie\rto ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie.\rFor other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to\rpersist the ID. The next time the user uses your app on that device, get the\rclient ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this\rheader.

Bing often flights new\rfeatures and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning\rtraffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a\ruser across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user to multiple\rconflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead\rto an inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second request has a\rdifferent flight assignment than the first, the experience may be\runexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that\rclient ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing\ralso uses this header to help improve result rankings by analyzing the\ractivity generated by a client ID. The relevance improvements help with\rbetter quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher\rclick-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you\rshould consider this header required. Persisting the client ID across\rmultiple requests for the same end user and device combination enables 1)\rthe API consumer to receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher\rclick-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each\ruser that uses your application on the device must have a unique, Bing\rgenerated client ID. If you do not include this header in the request, Bing\rgenerates an ID and returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The\ronly time that you should NOT include this header in a request is the first\rtime the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing\rAPI request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the\rclient ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie\rto ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie.\rFor other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to\rpersist the ID. The next time the user uses your app on that device, get the\rclient ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this\rheader. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use\rit for all subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device.

To determine the market to return results for, Bing uses\rthe first supported language it finds from the list and combines it with the\rcc parameter value. If the list does not include a supported language, Bing\rfinds the closest language and market that supports the request or it uses\ran aggregated or default market for the results. To determine the market\rthat Bing used, see the BingAPIs-Market header. Use this header and the cc\rquery parameter only if you specify multiple languages.

          description: "Bing uses this header to provide users\rwith consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new\rfeatures and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning\rtraffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a\ruser across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user to multiple\rconflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead\rto an inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second request has a\rdifferent flight assignment than the first, the experience may be\runexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that\rclient ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing\ralso uses this header to help improve result rankings by analyzing the\ractivity generated by a client ID. The relevance improvements help with\rbetter quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher\rclick-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you\rshould consider this header required. Persisting the client ID across\rmultiple requests for the same end user and device combination enables 1)\rthe API consumer to receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher\rclick-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each\ruser that uses your application on the device must have a unique, Bing\rgenerated client ID. If you do not include this header in the request, Bing\rgenerates an ID and returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The\ronly time that you should NOT include this header in a request is the first\rtime the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing\rAPI request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the\rclient ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie\rto ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie.\rFor other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to\rpersist the ID. The next time the user uses your app on that device, get the\rclient ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this\rheader. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use\rit for all subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If you\rinclude the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request."

      Binary Quantization, a type of compression method. In binary quantization,
      the original vectors values are compressed to the narrower binary type by
      discretizing and representing each component of a vector using binary
      values, thereby reducing the overall data size.

      Scalar Quantization, a type of compression method. In scalar quantization,
      the original vectors values are compressed to a narrower type by
      discretizing and representing each component of a vector using a reduced
      set of quantized values, thereby reducing the overall data size.

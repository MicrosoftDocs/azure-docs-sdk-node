      A comma-delimited list of one or more languages to use for user interface

      expected format, see

      [RFC2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). This
      header and the

      [setLang](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#setlang)

      also specify the

      [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#cc)

      query parameter. To determine the market to return results for, Bing uses
      the first supported

      language it finds from the list and combines it with the cc parameter
      value. If the list does

      not include a supported language, Bing finds the closest language and
      market that supports the

      request or it uses an aggregated or default market for the results. To
      determine the market

      that Bing used, see the BingAPIs-Market header. Use this header and the cc
      query parameter

      only if you specify multiple languages. Otherwise, use the

      [mkt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#mkt)

      and

      [setLang](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#setlang)

      Bing uses this header to provide users with consistent behavior across
      Bing API calls. Bing

      often flights new features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as
      a key for assigning

      traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a
      user across multiple

      requests, then Bing may assign the user to multiple conflicting flights.
      Being assigned to

      multiple conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience.
      For example, if the

      second request has a different flight assignment than the first, the
      experience may be

      unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that
      client ID’s search

      history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing also uses this
      header to help

      improve result rankings by analyzing the activity generated by a client
      ID. The relevance

      improvements help with better quality of results delivered by Bing APIs
      and in turn enables

      higher click-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although
      optional, you should

      consider this header required. Persisting the client ID across multiple
      requests for the same

      end user and device combination enables 1) the API consumer to receive a
      consistent user

      experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via better quality of
      results from the Bing

      APIs. Each user that uses your application on the device must have a
      unique, Bing generated

      client ID. If you do not include this header in the request, Bing
      generates an ID and returns

      it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you should
      NOT include this

      header in a request is the first time the user uses your app on that
      device. Use the client ID

      for each Bing API request that your app makes for this user on the device.
      Persist the client

      ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie to
      ensure the ID is used

      across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie. For other apps such as
      mobile apps, use the

      device's persistent storage to persist the ID. The next time the user uses
      your app on that

      device, get the client ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may
      not include this

      header. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID and
      use it for all

      subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If you include the
      X-MSEdge-ClientID,

      you must not include cookies in the request.

      behavior. Although

      optional, you are encouraged to always specify this header and the
      X-Search-Location header.

      Do not obfuscate the address (for example, by changing the last octet to
      0). Obfuscating the

      address results in the location not being anywhere near the device's
      actual location, which

      latitude of the client's

      location, in degrees. The latitude must be greater than or equal to -90.0
      and less than or

      equal to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern latitudes and positive

      longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal
      to +180.0. Negative

      values indicate western longitudes and positive values indicate eastern
      longitudes. re

      (required): The radius, in meters, which specifies the horizontal accuracy
      of the coordinates.

      Pass the value returned by the device's location service. Typical values
      might be 22m for

      GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP
      lookup. ts

      (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the location.
      (The UNIX timestamp

      is the number of seconds since January 1, 1970.) head (optional): The
      client's relative

      heading or direction of travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees
      from 0 through 360,

      counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp
      key is nonzero. sp

      (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters per second, that
      the client device is

      traveling. alt (optional): The altitude of the client device, in meters.
      are (optional): The

      radius, in meters, that specifies the vertical accuracy of the
      coordinates. Specify this key

      only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are optional,
      the more information

      Filter videos for adult content. The following are the possible filter
      values. Off: If the

      request is through the Video Search API, the response includes adult
      videos and the thumbnail

      images of the videos are clear (non-fuzzy). If the request is through the
      Web Search API, the

      response includes adult videos but the thumbnail images of the videos are
      pixelated (fuzzy).

      Moderate: If the request is through the Video Search API, the response
      does not include videos

      with adult content. If the request is through the Web Search API, the
      response may include

      videos with adult content but the thumbnail images of the videos are
      pixelated (fuzzy).

      Strict: Does not return videos with adult content. The default is
      Moderate. If the request

      comes from a market that Bing's adult policy requires that safeSearch is
      set to Strict, Bing

      ignores the safeSearch value and uses Strict. If you use the site: query
      operator, there is

      the chance that the response may contain adult content regardless of what
      the safeSearch query

      parameter is set to. Use site: only if you are aware of the content on the
      site and your

      scenario supports the possibility of adult content. Possible values

      'Moderate', 'Strict'

      Possible values are Raw—Use Unicode characters to mark content that needs
      special formatting.

      The Unicode characters are in the range E000 through E019. For example,
      Bing uses E000 and

      E001 to mark the beginning and end of query terms for hit highlighting.
      HTML—Use HTML tags to

      mark content that needs special formatting. For example, use <b> tags to
      highlight query terms

      in display strings. The default is Raw. For display strings that contain
      escapable HTML

      characters such as <, >, and &, if textFormat is set to HTML, Bing escapes
      the characters as

      appropriate (for example, < is escaped to &lt;). Possible values include:

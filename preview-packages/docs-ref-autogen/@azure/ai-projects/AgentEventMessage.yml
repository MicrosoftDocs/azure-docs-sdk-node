name: AgentEventMessage
uid: '@azure/ai-projects.AgentEventMessage'
package: '@azure/ai-projects'
summary: |-
  Each event in a server-sent events stream has an `event` and `data` property:
    
    ```
    event: thread.created
    data: {"id": "thread_123", "object": "thread", ...}
    ```
    
    We emit events whenever a new object is created, transitions to a new state, or is being
    streamed in parts (deltas). For example, we emit `thread.run.created` when a new run
    is created, `thread.run.completed` when a run completes, and so on. When an Agent chooses
    to create a message during a run, we emit a `thread.message.created event`, a
    `thread.message.in_progress` event, many `thread.message.delta` events, and finally a
    `thread.message.completed` event.
    
    We may add additional events over time, so we recommend handling unknown events gracefully
    in your code.*

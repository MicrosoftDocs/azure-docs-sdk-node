    summary: >
      Returns a promise that resolves to the value returned by the provided task
      function.

      Only 1 task can be invoked at a time for a given `key` value.

      An acquire call can be cancelled via an `abortSignal`.

      If cancelled, the promise will be rejected with an `AbortError`.


      `acquireTimeoutInMs` can also be provided to properties.

      If the timeout is reached before the provided `task` is invoked,

      then the promise will be rejected with an Error stating the task

      timed out waiting to acquire a lock.

    package: '@azure/arm-app'
    summary: >-
      Optional duration in seconds the pod needs to terminate gracefully upon
      probe failure. The grace period is the duration in seconds after the
      processes running in the pod are sent a termination signal and the time
      when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal. Set this value
      longer than the expected cleanup time for your process. If this value is
      nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this
      value overrides the value provided by the pod spec. Value must be
      non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via the
      kill signal (no opportunity to shut down). This is an alpha field and
      requires enabling ProbeTerminationGracePeriod feature gate. Maximum value
      is 3600 seconds (1 hour)

      Positive values will make tokens less likely to appear as their frequency
      increases and

      decrease the likelihood of the model repeating the same statements
      verbatim.

      and responds to the end-user. "auto" means the model can pick between an
      end-user or calling a function.
       Specifying a particular function via `{"name": "my_function"}` forces the model to call that function.
       "none" is the default when no functions are present. "auto" is the default if functions are present.

      a full ban or exclusive selection of a token, respectively. The exact

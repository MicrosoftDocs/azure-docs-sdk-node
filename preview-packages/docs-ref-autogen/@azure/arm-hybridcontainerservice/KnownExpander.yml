  - name: LeastWaste

    package: '@azure/arm-hybridcontainerservice'
    summary: >-
      Selects the node group that will have the least idle CPU (if tied, unused
      memory) after scale-up. This is useful when you have different classes of
      nodes, for example, high CPU or high memory nodes, and only want to expand
      those when there are pending pods that need a lot of those resources.
  - name: MostPods
    uid: '@azure/arm-hybridcontainerservice.KnownExpander.MostPods'
    package: '@azure/arm-hybridcontainerservice'
    summary: >-
      Selects the node group that would be able to schedule the most pods when
      scaling up. This is useful when you are using nodeSelector to make sure
      certain pods land on certain nodes. Note that this won't cause the
      autoscaler to select bigger nodes vs. smaller, as it can add multiple
      smaller nodes at once.
  - name: Priority
    uid: '@azure/arm-hybridcontainerservice.KnownExpander.Priority'
    package: '@azure/arm-hybridcontainerservice'
    summary: >-
      Selects the node group that has the highest priority assigned by the user.
      It's configuration is described in more details
      [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/expander/priority/readme.md).
  - name: Random
    uid: '@azure/arm-hybridcontainerservice.KnownExpander.Random'
    package: '@azure/arm-hybridcontainerservice'
    summary: >-
      Used when you don't have a particular need for the node groups to scale
      differently.

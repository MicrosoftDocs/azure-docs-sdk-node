      Enables authentication to Azure Active Directory using client secret

      details configured in the following environment variables:

      - AZURE_TENANT_ID: The Azure Active Directory tenant (directory) ID.

      - AZURE_CLIENT_ID: The client (application) ID of an App Registration in
      the tenant.

      - AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET: A client secret that was generated for the App
      Registration.


      This credential ultimately uses a <xref:ClientSecretCredential> to

      perform the authentication using these details.  Please consult the

      documentation of that class for more details.

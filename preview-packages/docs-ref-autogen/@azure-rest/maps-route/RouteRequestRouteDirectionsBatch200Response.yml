  **Route Directions Batch API**

  **Applies to**: see pricing [tiers](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPricingTier).




  The Route Directions Batch API sends batches of queries to [Route Directions
  API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections) using
  just a single API call. You can call Route Directions Batch API to run either
  asynchronously (async) or synchronously (sync). The async API allows caller to
  batch up to **700** queries and sync API up to **100** queries.

  ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request

  The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively
  complex route requests

  - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads
  are possible).

  - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run
  into a timeout.

  - The number of batch items is limited to **700** for this API.


  When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns
  a 202 response code along a redirect URL in the Location field of the response
  header. This URL should be checked periodically until the response data or
  error information is available.

  The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL
  returns a 404 response if used after the expiration period.


  Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running request. Here's
  a typical sequence of operations:

  1. Client sends a Route Directions Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps

  2. The server will respond with one of the following:

      > HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.

      > HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or any other `Error` status code.

  3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in
  the response contains the URL to download the results of the batch request.
      This status URI looks like following:

  ``` GET
  https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0
  ```

  Note:- Please remember to add AUTH information (subscription-key/azure_auth -
  See [Security](#security)) to the _status URI_ before running it. <br>

  4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to
  download the batch results.


  ### POST Body for Batch Request

  To send the _route directions_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the
  request body will contain the `batchItems` array in `json` format and the
  `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a sample
  request body containing 3 _route directions_ queries:



  ```json

  {
      "batchItems": [
          { "query": "?query=47.620659,-122.348934:47.610101,-122.342015&travelMode=bicycle&routeType=eco&traffic=false" },
          { "query": "?query=40.759856,-73.985108:40.771136,-73.973506&travelMode=pedestrian&routeType=shortest" },
          { "query": "?query=48.923159,-122.557362:32.621279,-116.840362" }
      ]
  }

  ```


  A _route directions_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the
  protocol, base URL, path, api-version and subscription-key. It can accept any
  of the supported _route directions_ [URI
  parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections#uri-parameters).
  The string values in the _route directions_ query must be properly escaped
  (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\ ) and it should also be properly
  URL-encoded.



  The async API allows caller to batch up to **700** queries and sync API up to
  **100** queries, and the batch should contain at least **1** query.



  ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results

  To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the
  batch download endpoint. This _download URL_ can be obtained from the
  `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
  following:


  ```

  https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&subscription-key={subscription-key}

  ```

  Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:

  1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.

  2. The server will respond with one of the following:

      > HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some time.

      > HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.



  ### Batch Response Model

  The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When
  downloading the results of an async batch request, if the batch has finished
  processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
  contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were
  part of the original batch request and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which
  were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a `batchItems`
  array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request.
  The `batchItems` will contain the results in the exact same order the original
  queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in `batchItems` contains
  `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one
  of the following types:

    - [`RouteDirections`](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections#routedirections) - If the query completed successfully.

    - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.


  Here's a sample Batch Response with 1 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:



  ```json

  {
      "summary": {
          "successfulRequests": 1,
          "totalRequests": 2
      },
      "batchItems": [
          {
              "statusCode": 200,

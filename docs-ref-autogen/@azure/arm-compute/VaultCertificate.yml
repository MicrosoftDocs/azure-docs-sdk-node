      For Windows VMs, specifies the certificate store on the Virtual Machine to
      which the certificate should be added. The specified certificate store is
      implicitly in the LocalMachine account. For Linux VMs, the certificate
      file is placed under the /var/lib/waagent directory, with the file name
      &lt;UppercaseThumbprint&gt;.crt for the X509 certificate file and
      &lt;UppercaseThumbprint&gt;.prv for private key. Both of these files are
      .pem formatted.

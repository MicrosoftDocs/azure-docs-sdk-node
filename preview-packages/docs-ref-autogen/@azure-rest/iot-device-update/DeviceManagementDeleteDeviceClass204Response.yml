  Deletes a device class. Device classes are created automatically when Device
  Update-enabled devices are connected to the hub but are not automatically
  cleaned up since they are referenced by DeviceClassSubgroups. If the user has
  deleted all DeviceClassSubgroups for a device class they can also delete the
  device class to remove the records from the system and to stop checking the
  compatibility of this device class with new updates. If a device is ever
  reconnected for this device class it will be re-created.

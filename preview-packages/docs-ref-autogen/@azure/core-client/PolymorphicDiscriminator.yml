summary: >-
  Used to disambiguate discriminated type unions.

  For example, if response can have many shapes but also includes a 'kind' field
  (or similar),

  that field can be used to determine how to deserialize the response to the
  correct type.

    summary: >-
      Name to use on the resulting object instead of the original property name.

      Useful since the JSON property could be difficult to work with.

      For example: For a field received as `@odata.kind`, the final object could
      instead include a property simply named `kind`.

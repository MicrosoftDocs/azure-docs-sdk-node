# Azure Core XML client library for JavaScript - version 1.5.1-alpha.20251022.1 


This library is primarily intended to be used in code generated by [AutoRest](https://github.com/Azure/Autorest) and [`autorest.typescript`](https://github.com/Azure/autorest.typescript) for APIs that require parsing XML payloads.

## Getting started

### Requirements

### Currently supported environments

- [LTS versions of Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule)
- Latest versions of Safari, Chrome, Edge, and Firefox.

See our [support policy](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/SUPPORT.md) for more details.

### Installation

This package is primarily used in generated code and not meant to be consumed directly by end users.

## Key concepts

XML parsing is mostly delegated to the browser and `xml2js`.

## Examples

Examples can be found in the `samples-dev` folder and can be ran using `npm run execute:samples`.

## Next steps

See `@azure/core-client` for actual usage.

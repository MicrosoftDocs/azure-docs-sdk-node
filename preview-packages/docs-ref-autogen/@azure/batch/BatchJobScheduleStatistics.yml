      The wait time for a Task is defined as the elapsed time between the
      creation of the Task and the start of Task execution. (If the Task is
      retried due to failures, the wait time is the time to the most recent Task
      execution.). This value is only reported in the Account lifetime
      statistics; it is not included in the Job statistics.

      the schedule. The wall clock time is the elapsed time from when the Task
      started running on a Compute Node to when it finished (or to the last time
      the statistics were updated, if the Task had not finished by then). If a
      Task was retried, this includes the wall clock time of all the Task
      retries.

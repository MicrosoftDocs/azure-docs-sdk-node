      Returns an async iterable iterator to list all the files and directories

      under the specified account.


      .byPage() returns an async iterable iterator to list the files and
      directories in pages.


      Example using `for await` syntax:


      ```js

      let i = 1;

      for await (const entity of directoryClient.listFilesAndDirectories()) {
        if (entity.kind === "directory") {
          console.log(`${i++} - directory\t: ${entity.name}`);
        } else {
          console.log(`${i++} - file\t: ${entity.name}`);
        }
      }

      ```


      Example using `iter.next()`:


      ```js

      let i = 1;

      let iter = directoryClient.listFilesAndDirectories();

      let entity = await iter.next();

      while (!entity.done) {
        if (entity.value.kind === "directory") {
          console.log(`${i++} - directory\t: ${entity.value.name}`);
        } else {
          console.log(`${i++} - file\t: ${entity.value.name}`);
        }
        entity = await iter.next();
      }

      ```


      Example using `byPage()`:


      ```js

      // passing optional maxPageSize in the page settings

      let i = 1;

      for await (const response of directoryClient
        .listFilesAndDirectories()
        .byPage({ maxPageSize: 20 })) {
        for (const fileItem of response.segment.fileItems) {
          console.log(`${i++} - file\t: ${fileItem.name}`);
        }
        for (const dirItem of response.segment.directoryItems) {
          console.log(`${i++} - directory\t: ${dirItem.name}`);
        }
      }

      ```


      Example using paging with a marker:


      ```js

      let i = 1;

      let iterator = directoryClient.listFilesAndDirectories().byPage({
      maxPageSize: 3 });

      let response = (await iterator.next()).value;


      // Prints 3 file and directory names

      for (const fileItem of response.segment.fileItems) {
        console.log(`${i++} - file\t: ${fileItem.name}`);
      }


      for (const dirItem of response.segment.directoryItems) {
        console.log(`${i++} - directory\t: ${dirItem.name}`);
      }


      // Gets next marker

      let dirMarker = response.continuationToken;


      // Passing next marker as continuationToken

      iterator = directoryClient
        .listFilesAndDirectories()
        .byPage({ continuationToken: dirMarker, maxPageSize: 4 });
      response = (await iterator.next()).value;


      // Prints 10 file and directory names

      for (const fileItem of response.segment.fileItems) {
        console.log(`${i++} - file\t: ${fileItem.name}`);
      }


      for (const dirItem of response.segment.directoryItems) {
        console.log(`${i++} - directory\t: ${dirItem.name}`);
      }

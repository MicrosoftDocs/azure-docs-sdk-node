      The amount of time (in minutes) to wait on eviction of pods and graceful
      termination per node. This eviction wait time honors waiting on pod
      disruption budgets. If this time is exceeded, the upgrade fails. If not
      specified, the default is 30 minutes.

      This can either be set to an integer (e.g. '5') or a percentage (e.g.

      agent pool size at the time of the upgrade. For percentages, fractional
      nodes are rounded up. If not specified, the default is 1. For more

    summary: >-
      Defines the behavior for undrainable nodes during upgrade. The most common
      cause of undrainable nodes is Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs), but other
      issues, such as pod termination grace period is exceeding the remaining
      per-node drain timeout or pod is still being in a running state, can also
      cause undrainable nodes.

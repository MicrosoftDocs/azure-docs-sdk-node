## Azure Synapse Managed Private Endpoints client library for JavaScript - version 1.0.0-beta.4 


This package contains an isomorphic SDK for Managed Private Endpoints.

## Getting started

### Install the package

```bash
npm install @azure/synapse-managed-private-endpoints
```

### Currently supported environments

- [LTS versions of Node.js](https://nodejs.org/about/releases/)

  let client = new ManagedPrivateEndpointsClient(
    credential,
    "https://mysynapse.dev.azuresynapse.net"

## Troubleshooting

Enabling logging may help uncover useful information about failures. In order to see a log of HTTP requests and responses, set the `AZURE_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to `info`. Alternatively, logging can be enabled at runtime by calling `setLogLevel` in the `@azure/logger`:

```javascript
import { setLogLevel } from "@azure/logger";

setLogLevel("info");
```

## Next steps

In the future, you'll find additional code samples here.

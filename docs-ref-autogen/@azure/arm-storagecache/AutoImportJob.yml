      How the auto import job will handle conflicts. For example, if the auto
      import job is trying to bring in a directory, but a file is at that path,
      how it handles it. Fail indicates that the auto import job should stop
      immediately and not do anything with the conflict. Skip indicates that it
      should pass over the conflict. OverwriteIfDirty causes the auto import job
      to delete and re-import the file or directory if it is a conflicting type,
      is dirty, or is currently released. OverwriteAlways extends
      OverwriteIfDirty to include releasing files that had been restored but
      were not dirty. Please reference
      https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-managed-lustre/blob-integration#conflict-resolution-mode

# Azure Monitor modules for JavaScript

Cloud applications are complex with many moving parts. Monitoring provides data to ensure that your application stays up and running in a healthy state. It also helps you to stave off potential problems or troubleshoot past ones. In addition, you can use monitoring data to gain deep insights about your application. That knowledge can help you to improve application performance or maintainability, or automate actions that would otherwise require manual intervention.

## Management Package

### Install npm module

```bash
pm install @azure/arm-monitor
```

### Samples

* Examples for using this module in Node.js as well as browser applications can be found in the [README for the module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/arm-monitor)

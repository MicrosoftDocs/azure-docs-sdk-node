      Id of a stateful service replica or a stateless service instance. This ID
      is used in the

      queries that apply to both stateful and stateless services. It is used by
      Service Fabric to

      uniquely identify a replica of a partition of a stateful service or an
      instance of a stateless

      service partition. It is unique within a partition and does not change for
      the lifetime of the

      replica or the instance. If a stateful replica gets dropped and another
      replica gets created

      on the same node for the same partition, it will get a different value for
      the ID. If a

      stateless instance is failed over on the same or different node it will
      get a different value

      for the ID.

  supplied, single load balancer mode will be used. Multiple standard load
  balancers mode will be used if at lease one configuration is supplied. There
  has to be a configuration named `kubernetes`. The name field will be the name
  of the corresponding public load balancer. There will be an internal load
  balancer created if needed, and the name will be `<name>-internal`. The
  internal lb shares the same configurations as the external one. The internal
  lbs are not needed to be included in LoadBalancer list.

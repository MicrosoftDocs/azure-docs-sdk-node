    package: '@azure/arm-postgresql-flexible'
    summary: >-
      Kills the primary database process first, then triggers the failover. This
      is more aggressive and used when the primary is unresponsive or in an
      unhealthy state.
  - name: ForcedSwitchover
    uid: '@azure/arm-postgresql-flexible.KnownFailoverMode.ForcedSwitchover'
    package: '@azure/arm-postgresql-flexible'

      Kills the primary database process and then triggers a switch over with
      role swapping.
  - name: PlannedFailover
    uid: '@azure/arm-postgresql-flexible.KnownFailoverMode.PlannedFailover'
    package: '@azure/arm-postgresql-flexible'
    summary: >-
      Triggers a failover from primary to standby without killing the primary
      database process first. This is a graceful failover that attempts to
      preserve data consistency.
  - name: PlannedSwitchover
    uid: '@azure/arm-postgresql-flexible.KnownFailoverMode.PlannedSwitchover'
    package: '@azure/arm-postgresql-flexible'
    summary: >-
      Similar to 'PlannedFailover' but prefers a switch over operation where
      roles are swapped between primary and standby.

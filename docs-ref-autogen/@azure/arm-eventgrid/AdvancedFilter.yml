      This is the base type that represents an advanced filter. To configure an
      advanced filter, do

      not directly instantiate an object of this class. Instead, instantiate an
      object of a derived

      class such as BoolEqualsAdvancedFilter, NumberInAdvancedFilter,
      StringEqualsAdvancedFilter etc.

      depending on the type of the key based on which you want to filter.

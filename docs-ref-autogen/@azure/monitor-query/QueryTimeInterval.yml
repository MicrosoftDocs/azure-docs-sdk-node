  Time Interval type for specifying timespan for querying logs and metrics.

  A time interval is the intervening time between two time points.

  The amount of intervening time is expressed by a duration The two time points
  (start and end) are expressed by either a combined date and time
  representation

  or just a date representation.There are four ways to express a time interval:

  - duration

  - start time, end time

  - start time, duration

  - duration, end time


  The duration is an ISO8601 duration value in the format
  P[n]Y[n]M[n]DT[n]H[n]M[n]S

  where  P is the duration designator (for period) placed at the start of the
  duration representation.
    Y is the year designator that follows the value for the number of years.
    M is the month designator that follows the value for the number of months.
    W is the week designator that follows the value for the number of weeks.
    D is the day designator that follows the value for the number of days.
    T is the time designator that precedes the time components of the representation.
    H is the hour designator that follows the value for the number of hours.
    M is the minute designator that follows the value for the number of minutes.
    S is the second designator that follows the value for the number of seconds.

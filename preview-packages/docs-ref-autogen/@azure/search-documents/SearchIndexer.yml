    summary: >-
      A description of an encryption key that you create in Azure Key Vault.
      This key is used to

      provide an additional level of encryption-at-rest for your indexer
      definition (as well as

      indexer execution status) when you want full assurance that no one, not
      even Microsoft, can

      decrypt them in Azure Cognitive Search. Once you have encrypted your
      indexer definition, it

      will always remain encrypted. Azure Cognitive Search will ignore attempts
      to set this property

      to null. You can change this property as needed if you want to rotate your
      encryption key;

      Your indexer definition (and indexer execution status) will be unaffected.
      Encryption with

      customer-managed keys is not available for free search services, and is
      only available for

      paid services created on or after January 1, 2019.

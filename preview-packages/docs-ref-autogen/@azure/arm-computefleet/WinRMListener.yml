      This is the URL of a certificate that has been uploaded to Key Vault as a

      secret. For adding a secret to the Key Vault, see [Add a key or secret to
      the

      key

      vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/key-vault-get-started/#add).

      In this case, your certificate needs to be the Base64 encoding of the
      following

      JSON Object which is encoded in UTF-8: <br><br> {<br>

      "data":"<Base64-encoded-certificate>",<br>  "dataType":"pfx",<br>

      "password":"<pfx-file-password>"<br>} <br> To install certificates on a
      virtual

      machine it is recommended to use the [Azure Key Vault virtual machine
      extension

      for

      Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/key-vault-linux)

      or the [Azure Key Vault virtual machine extension for

      Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/key-vault-windows).

      App/Framework specific environment support

      - isAngular                - flag set to determine if it is Angular
      Framework. MSAL uses this to broadcast tokens. More to come here: detangle
      this dependency from core.

      - unprotectedResources     - Array of URI's which are unprotected
      resources. MSAL will not attach a token to outgoing requests that have
      these URI. Defaults to 'null'.

      - protectedResourceMap     - This is mapping of resources to scopes used
      by MSAL for automatically attaching access tokens in web API calls.A
      single access token is obtained for the resource. So you can map a
      specific resource path as follows: {"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me",
      ["user.read"]}, or the app URL of the resource as:
      {"https://graph.microsoft.com/", ["user.read", "mail.send"]}. This is
      required for CORS calls.

        protectedResourceMap:Map<string>, unprotectedResources:Array<string> }

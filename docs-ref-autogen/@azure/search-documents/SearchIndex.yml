      A description of an encryption key that you create in Azure Key Vault.
      This key is used to

      provide an additional level of encryption-at-rest for your data when you
      want full assurance

      that no one, not even Microsoft, can decrypt your data in Azure Cognitive
      Search. Once you

      have encrypted your data, it will always remain encrypted. Azure Cognitive
      Search will ignore

      attempts to set this property to null. You can change this property as
      needed if you want to

      rotate your encryption key; Your data will be unaffected. Encryption with
      customer-managed

      keys is not available for free search services, and is only available for
      paid services

      created on or after January 1, 2019.

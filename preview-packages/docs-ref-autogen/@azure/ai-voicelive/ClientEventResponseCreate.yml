package: '@azure/ai-voicelive'
summary: |-
  This event instructs the server to create a Response, which means triggering
  model inference. When in Server VAD mode, the server will create Responses
  automatically.
  A Response will include at least one Item, and may have two, in which case
  the second will be a function call. These Items will be appended to the
  conversation history.
  The server will respond with a `response.created` event, events for Items
  and content created, and finally a `response.done` event to indicate the
  Response is complete.
  The `response.create` event includes inference configuration like
  `instructions`, and `temperature`. These fields will override the Session's
  configuration for this Response only.

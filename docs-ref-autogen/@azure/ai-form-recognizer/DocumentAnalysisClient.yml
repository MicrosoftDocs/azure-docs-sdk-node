    package: '@azure/ai-form-recognizer'
    summary: >-
      Extract data from an input using a model given by its unique ID.


      This operation supports custom as well as prebuilt models. For example, to
      use the prebuilt invoice model, provide

      the model ID "prebuilt-invoice", or to use the simpler prebuilt layout
      model, provide the model ID

      "prebuilt-layout".


      The fields produced in the `AnalyzeResult` depend on the model that is
      used for analysis, and the values in any

      extracted documents' fields depend on the document types in the model (if
      any) and their corresponding field

      schemas.


      ### Examples


      This method supports streamable request bodies
      ([FormRecognizerRequestBody](xref:@azure/ai-form-recognizer.FormRecognizerRequestBody))
      such as Node.JS `ReadableStream`

      objects, browser `Blob`s, and `ArrayBuffer`s. The contents of the body
      will be uploaded to the service for analysis.


      ```javascript

      import * as fs from "fs";


      const file = fs.createReadStream("path/to/receipt.pdf");


      // The model that is passed to the following function call determines the
      type of the eventual result. In the

      // example, we will use the prebuilt receipt model, but you could use a
      custom model ID/name instead.

      const poller = await client.beginAnalyzeDocument("prebuilt-receipt",
      file);


      // The result is a long-running operation (poller), which must itself be
      polled until the operation completes

      const {
        pages, // pages extracted from the document, which contain lines and words
        tables, // extracted tables, organized into cells that contain their contents
        styles, // text styles (ex. handwriting) that were observed in the document
        keyValuePairs, // extracted pairs of elements  (directed associations from one element in the input to another)
        entities, // extracted entities in the input's content, which are categorized (ex. "Location" or "Organization")
        documents // extracted documents (instances of one of the model's document types and its field schema)
      } = await poller.pollUntilDone();


      // Extract the fields of the first document. These fields constitute a
      receipt, because we used the receipt model

      const [{ fields: receipt }] = documents;


      // The fields correspond to the model's document types and their field
      schemas. Refer to the Form Recognizer

      // documentation for information about the document types and field
      schemas within a model, or use the `getModel`

      // operation to view this information programmatically.

      console.log("The type of this receipt is:",
      receipt?.["ReceiptType"]?.value);

      Extract data from an input using a model that has a known, strongly-typed
      document schema (a
      [DocumentModel](xref:@azure/ai-form-recognizer.DocumentModel)).


      The fields produced in the `AnalyzeResult` depend on the model that is
      used for analysis. In TypeScript, the type

      of the result for this method overload is inferred from the type of the
      input `DocumentModel`.


      ### Examples


      This method supports streamable request bodies
      ([FormRecognizerRequestBody](xref:@azure/ai-form-recognizer.FormRecognizerRequestBody))
      such as Node.JS `ReadableStream`

      objects, browser `Blob`s, and `ArrayBuffer`s. The contents of the body
      will be uploaded to the service for analysis.


      If the input provided is a string, it will be treated as a URL to the
      location of a document to be analyzed. See the

      [beginAnalyzeDocumentFromUrl](xref:@azure/ai-form-recognizer.DocumentAnalysisClient.beginAnalyzeDocumentFromUrl_1)
      method for more information. Use of that method is preferred when using
      URLs,

      and URL support is only provided in this method for backwards
      compatibility.


      ```typescript

      import * as fs from "fs";


      // See the `prebuilt` folder in the SDK samples
      (http://aka.ms/azsdk/formrecognizer/js/samples) for examples of

      // DocumentModels for known prebuilts.

      import { PrebuiltReceiptModel } from "./prebuilt-receipt.ts";


      const file = fs.createReadStream("path/to/receipt.pdf");


      // The model that is passed to the following function call determines the
      type of the eventual result. In the

      // example, we will use the prebuilt receipt model.

      const poller = await client.beginAnalyzeDocument(PrebuiltReceiptModel,
      file);


      // The result is a long-running operation (poller), which must itself be
      polled until the operation completes

      const {
        pages, // pages extracted from the document, which contain lines and words

      // Extract the fields of the first document. These fields constitute a
      receipt, because we used the receipt model

      const [{ fields: receipt }] = documents;


      // Since we used the strongly-typed PrebuiltReceiptModel object instead of
      the "prebuilt-receipt" model ID

      // string, the fields of the receipt are strongly-typed and have camelCase
      names (as opposed to PascalCase).

      ### Examples


      This method supports extracting data from a file at a given URL. The Form
      Recognizer service will attempt to

      download a file using the submitted URL, so the URL must be accessible
      from the public internet. For example, a SAS

      token can be used to grant read access to a blob in Azure Storage, and the
      service will use the SAS-encoded URL to

      request the file.


      ```javascript

      // the URL must be publicly accessible

      const url = "<receipt document url>";


      // The model that is passed to the following function call determines the
      type of the eventual result. In the

      // example, we will use the prebuilt receipt model, but you could use a

      polled until the operation completes

        styles, // text styles (ex. handwriting) that were observed in the document
        keyValuePairs, // extracted pairs of elements  (directed associations from one element in the input to another)

        documents // extracted documents (instances of one of the model's document types and its field schema)
      } = await poller.pollUntilDone();


      // Extract the fields of the first document. These fields constitute a

      This method produces a long-running operation (poller) that will
      eventually produce an `AnalyzeResult`. This is the

      same type as `beginAnalyzeDocument` and `beginAnalyzeDocumentFromUrl`, but
      the result will only contain a small

      subset of its fields. Only the `documents` field and `pages` field will be
      populated, and only minimal page

      information will be returned. The `documents` field will contain
      information about all the identified documents and

      the `docType` that they were classified as.

      This method supports streamable request bodies
      ([FormRecognizerRequestBody](xref:@azure/ai-form-recognizer.FormRecognizerRequestBody))
      such as Node.JS `ReadableStream`

      objects, browser `Blob`s, and `ArrayBuffer`s. The contents of the body
      will be uploaded to the service for analysis.


      ```typescript

      import * as fs from "fs";


      const file = fs.createReadStream("path/to/file.pdf");


      const poller = await client.beginClassifyDocument("<classifier ID>",
      file);


      // The result is a long-running operation (poller), which must itself be
      polled until the operation completes

      const {
        pages, // pages extracted from the document, which contain only basic information for classifiers
        documents // extracted documents and their types
      } = await poller.pollUntilDone();


      // We'll print the documents and their types

      for (const { docType } of documents) {
        console.log("The type of this document is:", docType);
      }

      ```

      Classify a document from a URL using a custom classifier given by its ID.


      This method produces a long-running operation (poller) that will
      eventually produce an `AnalyzeResult`. This is the

      same type as `beginAnalyzeDocument` and `beginAnalyzeDocumentFromUrl`, but
      the result will only contain a small

      subset of its fields. Only the `documents` field and `pages` field will be
      populated, and only minimal page

      information will be returned. The `documents` field will contain
      information about all the identified documents and

      the `docType` that they were classified as.


      ### Example


      This method supports extracting data from a file at a given URL. The Form
      Recognizer service will attempt to

      download a file using the submitted URL, so the URL must be accessible
      from the public internet. For example, a SAS

      token can be used to grant read access to a blob in Azure Storage, and the
      service will use the SAS-encoded URL to

      request the file.


      ```typescript

      // the URL must be publicly accessible

      const url = "<file url>";


      const poller = await client.beginClassifyDocument("<classifier ID>", url);


      // The result is a long-running operation (poller), which must itself be
      polled until the operation completes

      const {
        pages, // pages extracted from the document, which contain only basic information for classifiers
        documents // extracted documents and their types
      } = await poller.pollUntilDone();


      // We'll print the documents and their types

      for (const { docType } of documents) {
        console.log("The type of this document is:", docType);
      }

      ```

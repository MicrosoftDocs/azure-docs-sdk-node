      The port(s) to which UEs will connect for this flow. You can specify zero
      or more ports or port ranges. If you specify one or more ports or port
      ranges then you must specify a value other than `ip` in the `protocol`
      field. This is an optional setting. If you do not specify it then
      connections will be allowed on all ports. Port ranges must be specified as
      <FirstPort>-<LastPort>. For example: [`8080`, `8082-8085`].

    summary: >-
      A list of the allowed protocol(s) for this flow. If you want this flow to
      be able to use any protocol within the internet protocol suite, use the
      value `ip`. If you only want to allow a selection of protocols, you must
      use the corresponding IANA Assigned Internet Protocol Number for each
      protocol, as described in
      https://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml.
      For example, for UDP, you must use 17. If you use the value `ip` then you
      must leave the field `port` unspecified.

      The remote IP address(es) to which UEs will connect for this flow. If you
      want to allow connections on any IP address, use the value `any`.
      Otherwise, you must provide each of the remote IP addresses to which the
      packet core instance will connect for this flow. You must provide each IP
      address in CIDR notation, including the netmask (for example,
      192.0.2.54/24).

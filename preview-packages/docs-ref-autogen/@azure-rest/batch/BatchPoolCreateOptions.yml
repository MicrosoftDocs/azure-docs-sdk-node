      The list of Packages to be installed on each Compute Node in the Pool.
      When creating a pool, the package's application ID must be fully qualified
      (/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Batch/batchAccounts/{accountName}/applications/{applicationName}).
      Changes to Package references affect all new Nodes joining the Pool, but
      do not affect Compute Nodes that are already in the Pool until they are
      rebooted or reimaged. There is a maximum of 10 Package references on any
      given Pool.

      For Windows Nodes, the Batch service installs the Certificates to the

      For Linux Compute Nodes, the Certificates are stored in a directory inside
      the Task working directory and an environment variable
      AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the Task to query for this
      location.

      For Certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs' directory is
      created in the user's home directory (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and
      Certificates are placed in that directory.

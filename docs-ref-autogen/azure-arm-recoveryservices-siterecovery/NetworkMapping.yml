      Network Mapping model. Ideally it should have been possible to inherit
      this

      class from prev version in InheritedModels as long as there is no
      difference

      in structure or method signature. Since there were no base Models for

      certain fields and methods viz NetworkMappingProperties and Load with

      required return type, the class has been introduced in its entirety with

      references to base models to facilitate exensions in subsequent versions.

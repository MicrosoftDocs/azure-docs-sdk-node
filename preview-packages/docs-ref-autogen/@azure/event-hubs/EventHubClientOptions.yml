      The data transformer that will be used to encode and decode the sent and
      received messages respectively.

      If not provided then the `DefaultDataTransformer` is used which has the
      below `encode` & `decode` features

      - `encode`:
         - If event body is a Buffer, then the event is sent without any data transformation
         - Else, JSON.stringfy() is run on the body, and then converted to Buffer before sending the event
         - If JSON.stringify() fails at this point, the send operation fails too.
      - `decode`
         - The body receivied via the AMQP protocol is always of type Buffer
         - UTF-8 encoding is used to convert Buffer to string, and then JSON.parse() is run on it to get the event body
         - If the JSON.parse() fails at this point, then the originally received Buffer object is returned in the event body.

      This option should be provided in the below scenarios:

      Hubs is blocked in your environment.

      - Your application needs to be run behind a proxy server

      your own choice of Websocket implementation

      instead of the built-in WebSocket in the browser.

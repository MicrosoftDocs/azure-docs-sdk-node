  **Cordon**: AKS will cordon the blocked nodes and replace them with surge
  nodes during upgrade. The blocked nodes will be cordoned and replaced by surge
  nodes. The blocked nodes will have label
  'kubernetes.azure.com/upgrade-status:Quarantined'. A surge node will be
  retained for each blocked node. A best-effort attempt will be made to delete
  all other surge nodes. If there are enough surge nodes to replace blocked
  nodes, then the upgrade operation and the managed cluster will be in failed
  state. Otherwise, the upgrade operation and the managed cluster will be in
  canceled state. \

  **Schedule**: AKS will mark the blocked nodes schedulable, but the blocked
  nodes are not upgraded. A best-effort attempt will be made to delete all surge
  nodes. The upgrade operation and the managed cluster will be in failed state
  if there are any blocked nodes.

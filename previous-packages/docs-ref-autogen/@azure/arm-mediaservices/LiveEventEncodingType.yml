  ### Known values supported by the service

  **None**: This is the same as PassthroughStandard, please see description
  below. This enumeration value is being deprecated. \

  **Standard**: A contribution live encoder sends a single bitrate stream to the
  live event and Media Services creates multiple bitrate streams. The output
  cannot exceed 720p in resolution. \

  **Premium1080p**: A contribution live encoder sends a single bitrate stream to
  the live event and Media Services creates multiple bitrate streams. The output
  cannot exceed 1080p in resolution. \

  **PassthroughBasic**: The ingested stream passes through the live event from
  the contribution encoder without any further processing. In the
  PassthroughBasic mode, ingestion is limited to up to 5Mbps and only 1
  concurrent live output is allowed. Live transcription is not available. \

  **PassthroughStandard**: The ingested stream passes through the live event
  from the contribution encoder without any further processing. Live
  transcription is available. Ingestion bitrate limits are much higher and up to
  3 concurrent live outputs are allowed.

    summary: >-
      An implementation of the `AbortSignalLike` interface to signal the request
      to cancel lock acquisition.

      This only applies to the acquisition of a lock. Once the lock is acquired,
      the task is invoked and `acquire`

      can no longer be cancelled.

      This does not cancel running the task passed to `acquire()` if the lock
      has been acquired,

      but will prevent it from running if cancelled before the task is invoked.

      The allowed amount of time in milliseconds to acquire a lock.
      If a lock isn't acquired within this time, the promise returned
      by `acquire()` will be rejected with an Error.

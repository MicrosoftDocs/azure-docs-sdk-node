  ### Known values supported by the service

  **Parallel**: VMs under the node type are grouped into UDs and ignore the zone
  info in five UDs. This setting causes UDs across all zones to be upgraded at
  the same time. This deployment mode is faster for upgrades, we don't recommend
  it because it goes against the SDP guidelines, which state that the updates
  should be applied to one zone at a time. \

  **Hierarchical**: If this value is omitted or set to Hierarchical, VMs are
  grouped to reflect the zonal distribution in up to 15 UDs. Each of the three
  zones has five UDs. This ensures that the zones are updated one at a time,
  moving to next zone only after completing five UDs within the first zone. This
  update process is safer for the cluster and the user application.

  Describes the policy to be used for placement of a Service Fabric service
  where the service's

  Primary replicas should optimally be placed in a particular domain.


  This placement policy is usually used with fault domains in scenarios where
  the Service Fabric

  cluster is geographically distributed in order to indicate that a service's
  primary replica should

  be located in a particular fault domain, which in geo-distributed scenarios
  usually aligns with regional

  or datacenter boundaries. Note that since this is an optimization it is
  possible that the Primary replica

  may not end up located in this domain due to failures, capacity limits, or
  other constraints.

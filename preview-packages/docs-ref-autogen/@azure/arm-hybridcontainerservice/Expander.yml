  ### Known values supported by the service

  **least-waste**: Selects the node group that will have the least idle CPU (if
  tied, unused memory) after scale-up. This is useful when you have different
  classes of nodes, for example, high CPU or high memory nodes, and only want to
  expand those when there are pending pods that need a lot of those resources. \

  **most-pods**: Selects the node group that would be able to schedule the most
  pods when scaling up. This is useful when you are using nodeSelector to make
  sure certain pods land on certain nodes. Note that this won't cause the
  autoscaler to select bigger nodes vs. smaller, as it can add multiple smaller
  nodes at once. \

  **priority**: Selects the node group that has the highest priority assigned by
  the user. It's configuration is described in more details
  [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/expander/priority/readme.md).
  \

  **random**: Used when you don't have a particular need for the node groups to
  scale differently.

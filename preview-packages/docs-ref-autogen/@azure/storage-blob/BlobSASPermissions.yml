      This is a helper class to construct a string representing the permissions
      granted by a ServiceSAS to a blob. Setting

      a value to true means that any SAS which uses these permissions will grant
      permissions for that operation. Once all

      the values are set, this should be serialized with toString and set as the
      permissions field on a

      <xref:ServiceSASSignatureValues> object. It is possible to construct the
      permissions string without this class, but

      the order of the permissions is particular and this class guarantees
      correctness.

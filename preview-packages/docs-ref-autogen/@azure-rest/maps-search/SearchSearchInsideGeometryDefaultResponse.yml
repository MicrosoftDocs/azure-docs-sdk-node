  The Search Geometry endpoint allows you to perform a free form search inside a
  single geometry or many of them. The search results that fall inside the
  geometry/geometries will be returned.<br><br>To send the geometry you will use
  a `POST` request where the request body will contain the `geometry` object
  represented as a `GeoJSON` type and the `Content-Type` header will be set to
  `application/json`. The geographical features to be searched can be modeled as
  Polygon and/or Circle geometries represented using any one of the following
  `GeoJSON` types:<ul><li>**GeoJSON FeatureCollection** <br>The `geometry` can
  be represented as a `GeoJSON FeatureCollection` object. This is the
  recommended option if the geometry contains both Polygons and Circles. The
  `FeatureCollection` can contain a max of 50 `GeoJSON Feature` objects. Each
  `Feature` object should represent either a Polygon or a Circle with the
  following conditions:<ul style="list-style-type:none"><li>A `Feature` object
  for the Polygon geometry can have a max of 50 coordinates and it's properties
  must be empty.</li><li>A `Feature` object for the Circle geometry is composed
  of a _center_ represented using a `GeoJSON Point` type and a _radius_ value
  (in meters) which must be specified in the object's properties along with the
  _subType_ property whose value should be 'Circle'.</li></ul><br> Please see
  the Examples section below for a sample `FeatureCollection`
  representation.<br><br></li><li>**GeoJSON GeometryCollection**<br>The
  `geometry` can be represented as a `GeoJSON GeometryCollection` object. This
  is the recommended option if the geometry contains a list of Polygons only.
  The `GeometryCollection` can contain a max of 50 `GeoJSON Polygon` objects.
  Each `Polygon` object can have a max of 50 coordinates. Please see the
  Examples section below for a sample `GeometryCollection`
  representation.<br><br></li><li>**GeoJSON Polygon**<br>The `geometry` can be
  represented as a `GeoJSON Polygon` object. This is the recommended option if
  the geometry contains a single Polygon. The `Polygon` object can have a max of
  50 coordinates. Please see the Examples section below for a sample `Polygon`
  representation.<br><br></li></ul>.<br><br>

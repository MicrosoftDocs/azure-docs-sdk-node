      This field has no effect unless mode is 'Auto'. Warning: Changing this
      from Auto to None on an existing cluster will cause the default Karpenter
      NodePools to be deleted, which will in turn drain and delete the nodes
      associated with those pools. It is strongly recommended to not do this
      unless there are idle nodes ready to take the pods evicted by that action.
      If not specified, the default is Auto. For more information see

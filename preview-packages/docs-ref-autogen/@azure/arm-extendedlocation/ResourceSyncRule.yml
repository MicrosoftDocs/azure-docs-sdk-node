      A label selector is composed of two parts, matchLabels and
      matchExpressions. The first part, matchLabels is a map of {key,value}
      pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an
      element of matchExpressions, whose key field is 'key', the operator is
      'In', and the values array contains only 'value'. The second part,
      matchExpressions is a list of resource selector requirements. Valid
      operators include In, NotIn, Exists, and DoesNotExist. The values set must
      be non-empty in the case of In and NotIn. The values set must be empty in
      the case of Exists and DoesNotExist. All of the requirements, from both
      matchLabels and matchExpressions must all be satisfied in order to match.

      For an unmapped custom resource, its labels will be used to find matching
      resource sync rules. If this resource sync rule is one of the matching
      rules with highest priority, then the unmapped custom resource will be
      projected to the target resource group associated with this resource sync
      rule. The user creating this resource sync rule should have write
      permissions on the target resource group and this write permission will be
      validated when creating the resource sync rule.

  [KnownPodIPAllocationMode](xref:@azure/arm-containerservice.KnownPodIPAllocationMode)
  can be used interchangeably with PodIPAllocationMode,
   this enum contains the known values that the service supports.
  ### Known values supported by the service

  **DynamicIndividual**: Each node gets allocated with a non-contiguous list of
  IP addresses assignable to pods. This is better for maximizing a small to
  medium subnet of size /16 or smaller. The Azure CNI cluster with dynamic IP
  allocation defaults to this mode if the customer does not explicitly specify a
  podIPAllocationMode \

  **StaticBlock**: Each node is statically allocated CIDR block(s) of size /28 =
  16 IPs per block to satisfy the maxPods per node. Number of CIDR blocks >=
  (maxPods / 16). The block, rather than a single IP, counts against the Azure
  Vnet Private IP limit of 65K. Therefore block mode is suitable for running
  larger workloads with more than the current limit of 65K pods in a cluster.
  This mode is better suited to scale with larger subnets of /15 or bigger

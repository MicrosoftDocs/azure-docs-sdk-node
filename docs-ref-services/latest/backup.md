# Azure Backup Modules for JavaScript

## Overview

Azure Backup is the Azure-based service you can use to back up (or protect) and restore your data in the Microsoft cloud. Azure Backup replaces your existing on-premises or off-site backup solution with a cloud-based solution that is reliable, secure, and cost-competitive. Azure Backup offers multiple components that you download and deploy on the appropriate computer, server, or in the cloud. The component, or agent, that you deploy depends on what you want to protect. All Azure Backup components (no matter whether you're protecting data on-premises or in the cloud) can be used to back up data to a Recovery Services vault in Azure. 

## Management package

### Install the modules with npm

Use npm to install the Azure Backup modules for JavaScript

```bash
npm install @azure/arm-recoveryservicesbackup
```

## Samples

* Examples for using this module in Node.js as well as browser applications can be found in the [README for the module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/arm-recoveryservicesbackup)

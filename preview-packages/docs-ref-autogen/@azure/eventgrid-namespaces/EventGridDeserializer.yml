summary: >-
  EventGridDeserializer is used to aid in processing events delivered by
  EventGrid. It can deserialize a JSON encoded payload

  of either a single event or batch of events as well as be used to convert the
  result of `JSON.parse` into an

  `EventGridEvent` or `CloudEvent` like object.


  Unlike normal JSON deseralization, EventGridDeserializer does some additional
  conversions:


  - The consumer parses the event time property into a `Date` object, for ease
  of use.

  - When deserializing an event in the CloudEvent schema, if the event contains
  binary data, it is base64 decoded
    and returned as an instance of the `Uint8Array` type.

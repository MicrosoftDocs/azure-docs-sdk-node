    summary: >
      Optimized sequence of waypoints. It shows the index from the user provided
      waypoint sequence for the original and optimized list. For instance, a
      response:

      ```

      <optimizedWaypoints>

      <waypoint providedIndex="0" optimizedIndex="1"/>

      <waypoint providedIndex="1" optimizedIndex="2"/>

      <waypoint providedIndex="2" optimizedIndex="0"/>

      </optimizedWaypoints>

      ```


      means that the original sequence is [0, 1, 2] and optimized sequence is
      [1, 2, 0]. Since the index starts by 0 the original is "first, second,
      third" while the optimized is "second, third, first".

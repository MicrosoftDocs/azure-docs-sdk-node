      WebSocket.

      This option should be provided in the below scenarios:

      - The TCP port 5671 which is that is used by the AMQP connection to Event
      Hubs is blocked in your environment.

      - Your application needs to be run behind a proxy server.

      - Your application needs to run in the browser and you want to provide
      your own choice of Websocket implementation
        instead of the built-in WebSocket in the browser.

    summary: >-
      The exit code of the program specified on the Task command line. This
      property is set only if

      the Task is in the completed state. In general, the exit code for a
      process reflects the

      specific convention implemented by the application developer for that
      process. If you use the

      exit code value to make decisions in your code, be sure that you know the
      exit code convention

      used by the application process. However, if the Batch service terminates
      the Task (due to

      timeout, or user termination via the API) you may see an operating
      system-defined exit code.

    summary: >-
      The most recent time at which a retry of the Task started running. This
      element is present

      only if the Task was retried (i.e. retryCount is nonzero). If present,
      this is typically the

      same as startTime, but may be different if the Task has been restarted for
      reasons other than

      retry; for example, if the Compute Node was rebooted during a retry, then
      the startTime is

      updated but the lastRetryTime is not.

    summary: >-
      The number of times the Task has been requeued by the Batch service as the
      result of a user

      request. When the user removes Compute Nodes from a Pool (by
      resizing/shrinking the pool) or

      when the Job is being disabled, the user can specify that running Tasks on
      the Compute Nodes

      be requeued for execution. This count tracks how many times the Task has
      been requeued for

      these reasons.

    uid: '@azure/batch.BatchServiceModels.TaskExecutionInformation.retryCount'
    package: '@azure/batch'
    summary: >-
      The number of times the Task has been retried by the Batch service. Task
      application failures

      (non-zero exit code) are retried, pre-processing errors (the Task could
      not be run) and file

      upload errors are not retried. The Batch service will retry the Task up to
      the limit specified

      by the constraints.

    package: '@azure/batch'
    summary: >-
      The time at which the Task started running. 'Running' corresponds to the
      running state, so if

      the Task specifies resource files or Packages, then the start time
      reflects the time at which

      the Task started downloading or deploying these. If the Task has been
      restarted or retried,

      this is the most recent time at which the Task started running. This
      property is present only

      for Tasks that are in the running or completed state.

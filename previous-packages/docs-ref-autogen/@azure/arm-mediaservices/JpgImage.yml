      should be a positive integer and a proper value is recommended so that the

      limit 65535x65535.

      time), or a frame count (For example, 300 to stop at the 300th frame from
      the frame at start time. If this value is 1, it means only producing one
      thumbnail at start time), or a relative value to the stream duration (For
      example, 50% to stop at half of stream duration from start time). The
      default value is 100%, which means to stop at the end of the stream.

      The position in the input video from where to start generating thumbnails.
      The value can be in ISO 8601 format (For example, PT05S to start at 5
      seconds), or a frame count (For example, 10 to start at the 10th frame),
      or a relative value to stream duration (For example, 10% to start at 10%
      of stream duration). Also supports a macro {Best}, which tells the encoder
      to select the best thumbnail from the first few seconds of the video and
      will only produce one thumbnail, no matter what other settings are for
      Step and Range. The default value is macro {Best}.

    uid: '@azure/arm-mediaservices.JpgImage.step'
    package: '@azure/arm-mediaservices'
    summary: >-
      The intervals at which thumbnails are generated. The value can be in ISO
      8601 format (For example, PT05S for one image every 5 seconds), or a frame
      count (For example, 30 for one image every 30 frames), or a relative value
      to stream duration (For example, 10% for one image every 10% of stream
      duration). Note: Step value will affect the first generated thumbnail,
      which may not be exactly the one specified at transform preset start time.
      This is due to the encoder, which tries to select the best thumbnail
      between start time and Step position from start time as the first output.
      As the default value is 10%, it means if stream has long duration, the
      first generated thumbnail might be far away from the one specified at
      start time. Try to select reasonable value for Step if the first thumbnail
      is expected close to start time, or set Range value at 1 if only one
      thumbnail is needed at start time.

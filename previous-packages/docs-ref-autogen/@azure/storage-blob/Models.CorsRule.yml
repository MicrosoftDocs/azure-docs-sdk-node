  CORS is an HTTP feature that enables a web application running under one
  domain to access

  resources in another domain. Web browsers implement a security restriction
  known as same-origin

  policy that prevents a web page from calling APIs in a different domain; CORS
  provides a secure

  way to allow one domain (the origin domain) to call APIs in another domain

      The origin domain is the domain from which the request originates. Note
      that the origin must

      be an exact case-sensitive match with the origin that the user age sends
      to the service. You

      can also use the wildcard character '*' to allow all origin domains to
      make requests via CORS.

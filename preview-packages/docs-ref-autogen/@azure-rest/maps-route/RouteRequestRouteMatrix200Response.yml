  The Matrix Routing service allows calculation of a matrix of route summaries
  for a set of routes defined by origin and destination locations by using an
  asynchronous (async) or synchronous (sync) POST request. For every given
  origin, the service calculates the cost of routing from that origin to every
  given destination. The set of origins and the set of destinations can be
  thought of as the column and row headers of a table and each cell in the table
  contains the costs of routing from the origin to the destination for that
  cell. As an example, let's say a food delivery company has 20 drivers and they
  need to find the closest driver to pick up the delivery from the restaurant.
  To solve this use case, they can call Matrix Route API.



  For each route, the travel times and distances are returned. You can use the
  computed costs to determine which detailed routes to calculate using the Route
  Directions API.



  The maximum size of a matrix for async request is **700** and for sync request
  it's **100** (the number of origins multiplied by the number of destinations).




  ### Submit Synchronous Route Matrix Request

  If your scenario requires synchronous requests and the maximum size of the
  matrix is less than or equal to 100, you might want to make synchronous
  request. The maximum size of a matrix for this API is **100** (the number of
  origins multiplied by the number of destinations). With that constraint in
  mind, examples of possible matrix dimensions are: 10x10, 6x8, 9x8 (it does not
  need to be square).


  ```

  POST
  https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/sync/json?api-version=1.0&subscription-key={subscription-key}

  ```


  ### Submit Asynchronous Route Matrix Request

  The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively
  complex routing requests. When you make a request by using async request, by
  default the service returns a 202 response code along a redirect URL in the
  Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically
  until the response data or error information is available. If `waitForResults`
  parameter in the request is set to true, user will get a 200 response if the
  request is finished under 120 seconds.



  The maximum size of a matrix for this API is **700** (the number of origins
  multiplied by the number of destinations). With that constraint in mind,
  examples of possible matrix dimensions are: 50x10, 10x10, 28x25. 10x70 (it
  does not need to be square).



  The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL
  returns a 404 response if used after the expiration period.





  ```

  POST
  https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/json?api-version=1.0&subscription-key={subscription-key}

  ```


  Here's a typical sequence of asynchronous operations:

  1. Client sends a Route Matrix POST request to Azure Maps


  2. The server will respond with one of the following:

      > HTTP `202 Accepted` -  Route Matrix request has been accepted.

      > HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Route Matrix request. This could either be a 400 Bad Request or any other Error status code.


  3. If the Matrix Route request was accepted successfully, the Location header
  in the response contains the URL to download the results of the request. This
  status URI looks like the following:

    ```
      GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/{matrixId}?api-version=1.0?subscription-key={subscription-key}
    ```


  4. Client issues a GET request on the download URL obtained in Step 3 to
  download the results


  ### Download Sync Results

  When you make a POST request for Route Matrix Sync API, the service returns
  200 response code for successful request and a response array. The response
  body will contain the data and there will be no possibility to retrieve the
  results later.


  ### Download Async Results

  When a request issues a `202 Accepted` response, the request is being
  processed using our async pipeline. You will be given a URL to check the
  progress of your  async request in the location header of the response. This
  status URI looks like the following:

  ```
    GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/{matrixId}?api-version=1.0?subscription-key={subscription-key}
  ```


  The URL provided by the location header will return the following responses
  when a `GET` request is issued.

    > HTTP `202 Accepted` - Matrix request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some time.

    > HTTP `200 OK` - Matrix request successfully processed. The response body contains all of the results.

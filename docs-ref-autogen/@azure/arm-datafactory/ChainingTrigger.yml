summary: >-
  Trigger that allows the referenced pipeline to depend on other pipeline runs
  based on

  runDimension Name/Value pairs. Upstream pipelines should declare the same
  runDimension Name and

  their runs should have the values for those runDimensions. The referenced
  pipeline run would be

  triggered if the values for the runDimension match for all upstream pipeline
  runs.

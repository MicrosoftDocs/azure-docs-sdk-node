      Specifies the level of filtering performed on geographies. Narrows the
      search for specified geography entity types, e.g. return only
      municipality. The resulting response will contain the geography ID as well
      as the entity type matched. If you provide more than one entity as a comma
      separated list, endpoint will return the 'smallest entity available'.
      Returned Geometry ID can be used to get the geometry of that geography via
      [Get Search
      Polygon](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search/getsearchpolygon)
      API. The following parameters are ignored when entityType is set:

      * heading

      Indexes for which extended postal codes should be included in the results.

      Available indexes are:

       **Addr** = Address ranges

       **Geo** = Geographies

       **PAD** = Point Addresses

       **POI** = Points of Interest

       **Str** = Streets

       **XStr** = Cross Streets (intersections)

      Value should be a comma separated list of index types (in any order) or
      **None** for no indexes.


      By default extended postal codes are included for all indexes except Geo.
      Extended postal code lists for geographies can be quite long so they have
      to be explicitly requested when needed.


      Usage examples:

       extendedPostalCodesFor=POI

       extendedPostalCodesFor=PAD,Addr,POI

       extendedPostalCodesFor=None

      Extended postal code is returned as an **extendedPostalCode** property of
      an address. Availability is region-dependent.

    summary: >
      The View parameter (also called the "user region" parameter) allows you to
      show the correct maps for a certain country/region for geopolitically
      disputed regions. Different countries/regions have different views of such
      regions, and the View parameter allows your application to comply with the
      view required by the country/region your application will be serving. By
      default, the View parameter is set to “Unified” even if you haven’t
      defined it in  the request. It is your responsibility to determine the
      location of your users, and then set the View parameter correctly for that
      location. Alternatively, you have the option to set ‘View=Auto’, which
      will return the map data based on the IP  address of the request. The View
      parameter in Azure Maps must be used in compliance with applicable laws,
      including those  regarding mapping, of the country/region where maps,
      images and other data and third party content that you are authorized to 
      access via Azure Maps is made available. Example: view=IN.

      Please refer to [Supported
      Views](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsLocalizationViews) for details and to see
      the available Views.

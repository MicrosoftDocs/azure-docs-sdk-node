summary: >-
  Batch will retry Tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a Node.
  Examples of recovery

  operations include (but are not limited to) when an unhealthy Node is rebooted
  or a Compute Node

  disappeared due to host failure. Retries due to recovery operations are
  independent of and are

  not counted against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the maxTaskRetryCount is 0,
  an internal retry

  due to a recovery operation may occur. Because of this, all Tasks should be
  idempotent. This

  means Tasks need to tolerate being interrupted and restarted without causing
  any corruption or

  duplicate data. The best practice for long running Tasks is to use some form
  of checkpointing.

  In some cases the StartTask may be re-run even though the Compute Node was not
  rebooted. Special

  care should be taken to avoid StartTasks which create breakaway process or
  install/launch

  services from the StartTask working directory, as this will block Batch from
  being able to

  re-run the StartTask.

      The maximum number of times the Task may be retried. The Batch service
      retries a Task if its

      exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls the
      number of retries. The

      Batch service will try the Task once, and may then retry up to this limit.
      For example, if the

      maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the Task up to 4 times (one initial
      try and 3 retries).

      If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the
      Task. If the maximum

      retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the Task without limit.

      Whether the Batch service should wait for the StartTask to complete
      successfully (that is, to

      exit with exit code 0) before scheduling any Tasks on the Compute Node. If
      true and the

      StartTask fails on a Node, the Batch service retries the StartTask up to
      its maximum retry

      count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the Task has still not completed
      successfully after all retries,

      then the Batch service marks the Node unusable, and will not schedule
      Tasks to it. This

      condition can be detected via the Compute Node state and failure info
      details. If false, the

      Batch service will not wait for the StartTask to complete. In this case,
      other Tasks can start

      executing on the Compute Node while the StartTask is still running; and
      even if the StartTask

      fails, new Tasks will continue to be scheduled on the Compute Node. The
      default is true.

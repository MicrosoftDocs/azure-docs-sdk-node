  Specifies the execution mode. In Audit mode, the system acts as if it is
  enforcing the access control policy, including emitting access denial entries
  in the logs but it does not actually deny any requests to host endpoints. In
  Enforce mode, the system will enforce the access control and it is the
  recommended mode of operation.

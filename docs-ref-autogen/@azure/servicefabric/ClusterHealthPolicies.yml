      Defines a map that contains specific application health policies for
      different applications.

      Each entry specifies as key the application name and as value an
      ApplicationHealthPolicy used

      to evaluate the application health.

      If an application is not specified in the map, the application health
      evaluation uses the

      ApplicationHealthPolicy found in its application manifest or the default
      application health

      policy (if no health policy is defined in the manifest).

      The map is empty by default.

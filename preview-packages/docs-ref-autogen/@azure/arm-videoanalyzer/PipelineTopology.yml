  Pipeline topology describes the processing steps to be applied when processing
  content for a particular outcome. The topology should be defined according to
  the scenario to be achieved and can be reused across many pipeline instances
  which share the same processing characteristics. For instance, a pipeline
  topology which captures content from a RTSP camera and archives the content
  can be reused across many different cameras, as long as the same processing is
  to be applied across all the cameras. Individual instance properties can be
  defined through the use of user-defined parameters, which allow for a topology
  to be parameterized. This allows  individual pipelines refer to different
  values, such as individual cameras' RTSP endpoints and credentials. Overall a
  topology is composed of the following:
    - Parameters: list of user defined parameters that can be references across the topology nodes.
    - Sources: list of one or more data sources nodes such as an RTSP source which allows for content to be ingested from cameras.
    - Processors: list of nodes which perform data analysis or transformations.
    - Sinks: list of one or more data sinks which allow for data to be stored or exported to other destinations.

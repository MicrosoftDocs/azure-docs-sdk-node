    summary: >-
      Specifies the execution mode. In Audit mode, the system acts as if it is
      enforcing the access control policy, including emitting access denial
      entries in the logs but it does not actually deny any requests to host
      endpoints. In Enforce mode, the system will enforce the access control and
      it is the recommended mode of operation.

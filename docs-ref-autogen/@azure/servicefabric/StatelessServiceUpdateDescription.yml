      properties

      corresponds to a flag, specified below, which, if set, indicate that the
      property is

      specified.

      This property can be a combination of those flags obtained using bitwise
      'OR' operator.

      For example, if the provided value is 6 then the flags for
      ReplicaRestartWaitDuration (2) and

      QuorumLossWaitDuration (4) are set.

      - None - Does not indicate any other properties are set. The value is
      zero.

      - TargetReplicaSetSize/InstanceCount - Indicates whether the
      TargetReplicaSetSize property

      (for Stateful services) or the InstanceCount property (for Stateless
      services) is set. The

      value is 1.

      - ReplicaRestartWaitDuration - Indicates the ReplicaRestartWaitDuration
      property is set. The

      value is  2.

      - QuorumLossWaitDuration - Indicates the QuorumLossWaitDuration property
      is set. The value is

      4.

      - StandByReplicaKeepDuration - Indicates the StandByReplicaKeepDuration
      property is set. The

      value is 8.

      - MinReplicaSetSize - Indicates the MinReplicaSetSize property is set. The
      value is 16.

      - PlacementConstraints - Indicates the PlacementConstraints property is
      set. The value is 32.

      - PlacementPolicyList - Indicates the ServicePlacementPolicies property is
      set. The value is

      64.

      - Correlation - Indicates the CorrelationScheme property is set. The value
      is 128.

      - Metrics - Indicates the ServiceLoadMetrics property is set. The value is
      256.

      - DefaultMoveCost - Indicates the DefaultMoveCost property is set. The
      value is 512.

      - ScalingPolicy - Indicates the ScalingPolicies property is set. The value
      is 1024.

      - ServicePlacementTimeLimit - Indicates the ServicePlacementTimeLimit
      property is set. The

      value is 2048.

      - MinInstanceCount - Indicates the MinInstanceCount property is set. The
      value is 4096.

      - MinInstancePercentage - Indicates the MinInstancePercentage property is
      set. The value is

      8192.

      application/cluster upgrade and disabling node.

      The endpoint exposed on this instance is removed prior to starting the

      new connections to this instance.

      events(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.fabric.fabricclient.servicemanagementclient.registerservicenotificationfilterasync),

      can do

      the following upon receiving the endpoint removal notification:

      - Stop sending new requests to this instance.

      - Close existing connections after in-flight requests have completed.

      - Connect to a different instance of the service partition for future
      requests.

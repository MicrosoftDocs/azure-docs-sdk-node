      The `EventHubConsumerClient` class is used to consume events from an Event
      Hub.

      There are multiple ways to create an `EventHubConsumerClient`

      - Use the connection string from the SAS policy created for your Event Hub
      instance.

      - Use the connection string from the SAS policy created for your Event Hub
      namespace,

      and the name of the Event Hub instance

      - Use the full namespace like `<yournamespace>.servicebus.windows.net`,
      and a credentials object.


      Optionally, you can also pass:

      - An options bag to configure the retry policy or proxy settings.

      - A checkpoint store that is used by the client to read checkpoints to
      determine the position from where it should

      resume receiving events when your application gets restarted. The
      checkpoint store is also used by the client

      to load balance multiple instances of your application.

      If checkpoint store is provided to the `EventHubConsumerClient` and there

      instances of your application, then each instance will subscribe to a
      subset of the

      partitions such that the load is balanced amongst them.

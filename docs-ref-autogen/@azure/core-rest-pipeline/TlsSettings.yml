      Cert chains in PEM format. One cert chain should be provided per
       private key. Each cert chain should consist of the PEM formatted
       certificate for a provided private key, followed by the PEM
       formatted intermediate certificates (if any), in order, and not
       including the root CA (the root CA must be pre-known to the peer,
       see ca). When providing multiple cert chains, they do not have to
       be in the same order as their private keys in key. If the
       intermediate certificates are not provided, the peer will not be
       able to validate the certificate, and the handshake will fail.

      Private keys in PEM format. PEM allows the option of private keys

      being encrypted. Encrypted keys will be decrypted with

      options.passphrase. Multiple keys using different algorithms can be

      provided either as an array of unencrypted key strings or buffers,

      or an array of objects in the form `{pem: <string|buffer>[,passphrase:
      <string>]}`.

      The object form can only occur in an array.object.passphrase is optional.

      Encrypted keys will be decrypted with object.passphrase if provided, or
      options.passphrase if it is not.

      alternative to providing key and cert individually. PFX is usually

      encrypted, if it is, passphrase will be used to decrypt it. Multiple

      PFX can be provided either as an array of unencrypted PFX buffers,

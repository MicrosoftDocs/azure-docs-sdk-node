      The list of Application Packages to be installed on each Compute Node in
      the Pool. The list replaces any existing Application Package references on
      the Pool. Changes to Application Package references affect all new Compute
      Nodes joining the Pool, but do not affect Compute Nodes that are already
      in the Pool until they are rebooted or reimaged. There is a maximum of 10
      Application Package references on any given Pool. If omitted, or if you
      specify an empty collection, any existing Application Packages references
      are removed from the Pool. A maximum of 10 references may be specified on
      a given Pool.

    summary: >-
      This list replaces any existing Certificate references configured on the
      Pool.

      If you specify an empty collection, any existing Certificate references
      are removed from the Pool.

      For Windows Nodes, the Batch service installs the Certificates to the
      specified Certificate store and location.

      For Linux Compute Nodes, the Certificates are stored in a directory inside
      the Task working directory and an environment variable
      AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the Task to query for this
      location.

      For Certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs' directory is
      created in the user's home directory (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and
      Certificates are placed in that directory.

      Warning: This property is deprecated and will be removed after February,
      2024. Please use the [Azure KeyVault
      Extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/batch/batch-certificate-migration-guide)
      instead.

      A Task to run on each Compute Node as it joins the Pool. The Task runs
      when the Compute Node is added to the Pool or when the Compute Node is

      StartTask. If omitted, any existing StartTask is removed from the Pool.

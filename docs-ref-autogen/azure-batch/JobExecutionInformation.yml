      This element contains the actual pool where the job is assigned. When you
      get job

      details from the service, they also contain a poolInfo element, which
      contains the pool

      configuration data from when the job was added or updated. That poolInfo
      element may also

      contain a poolId element. If it does, the two IDs are the same. If it does
      not, it means the

      job ran on an auto pool, and this property contains the ID of that auto
      pool.

      This property is set only if the job is in the completed state. If the
      Batch

      service terminates the job, it sets the reason as follows: JMComplete -
      the Job Manager task

      completed, and killJobOnCompletion was set to true. MaxWallClockTimeExpiry
      - the job reached

      its maxWallClockTime constraint. TerminateJobSchedule - the job ran as
      part of a schedule, and

      the schedule terminated. AllTasksComplete - the job's onAllTasksComplete
      attribute is set to

      terminatejob, and all tasks in the job are complete. TaskFailed - the
      job's onTaskFailure

      attribute is set to performExitOptionsJobAction, and a task in the job
      failed with an exit

      condition that specified a jobAction of terminatejob. Any other string is
      a user-defined

      reason specified in a call to the 'Terminate a job' operation.

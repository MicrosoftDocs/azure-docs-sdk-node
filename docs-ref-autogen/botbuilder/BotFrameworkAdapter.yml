    remarks: >-
      Use this adapter to connect your bot to the Bot Framework service, through
      which

      your bot can reach many chat channels like Skype, Slack, and Teams. This
      adapter

      also allows your bot to work with the Bot Framework Emulator, which
      simulates

      the Bot Framework service and provides a chat interface for testing and
      debugging.


      The following example shows the typical adapter setup:


      ```JavaScript

      const { BotFrameworkAdapter } = require('botbuilder');


      const adapter = new BotFrameworkAdapter({
         appId: process.env.MICROSOFT_APP_ID,
         appPassword: process.env.MICROSOFT_APP_PASSWORD

      This is often referred to as the bot's "Proactive Messaging" flow as it
      lets the bot proactively

      send messages to a conversation or user without having to reply directly
      to an incoming message.

      Scenarios like sending notifications or coupons to a user are enabled by
      this method.


      In order to use this method, a ConversationReference must first be
      extracted from an incoming

      activity. This reference can be stored in a database and used to resume
      the conversation at a later time.

      The reference can be created from any incoming activity using
      `TurnContext.getConversationReference(context.activity)`.


      The processing steps for this method are very similar to
      [processActivity()](#processactivity)

      in that a `TurnContext` will be created which is then routed through the
      adapters middleware

      before calling the passed in logic handler. The key difference is that
      since an activity

      wasn't actually received from outside, it has to be created by the bot. 
      The created activity will have its address

      related fields populated but will have a `context.activity.type ===
      undefined`.


      ```JavaScript

      server.post('/api/notifyUser', async (req, res) => {
         // Lookup previously saved conversation reference
         const reference = await findReference(req.body.refId);

      This method is the main way a bot receives incoming messages.


      This method takes a raw incoming request object from a webserver and
      processes it into a

      normalized TurnContext that can be used by the bot. This includes any
      messages sent from a

      user and is the method that drives what is often referred to as the bot's
      "Reactive Messaging"

      flow.


      The following steps will be taken to process the activity:


      - The identity of the sender will be verified to be either the Emulator or
      a valid Microsoft
        server. The bots `appId` and `appPassword` will be used during this process and the request
        will be rejected if the senders identity can't be verified.
      - The activity will be parsed from the body of the incoming request. An
      error will be returned
        if the activity can't be parsed.
      - A `TurnContext` instance will be created for the received activity and
      wrapped with a
        [Revocable Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy/revocable).
      - The context will be routed through any middleware registered with the
      adapter using
        [use()](#use).  Middleware is executed in the order in which it's added and any middleware
        can intercept or prevent further routing of the context by simply not calling the passed
        in `next()` function. This is called the "Leading Edge" of the request; middleware will
        get a second chance to run on the "Trailing Edge" of the request after the bots logic has run.
      - Assuming the context hasn't been intercepted by a piece of middleware,
      the context will be
        passed to the logic handler passed in.  The bot may perform additional routing or
        processing at this time. Returning a promise (or providing an `async` handler) will cause the
        adapter to wait for any asynchronous operations to complete.
      - Once the bot's logic completes, the promise chain set up by the
      middleware stack will be resolved,
        giving middleware a second chance to run on the "Trailing Edge" of the request.
      - After the middleware stack's promise chain has been fully resolved the
      context object will be
        `revoked()` and any future calls to the context will result in a `TypeError: Cannot perform
        'set' on a proxy that has been revoked` being thrown.

      > [!TIP]

      > Note: If you see the error `TypeError: Cannot perform 'set' on a proxy
      that has been revoked`

      The activities will be sent one after another in the order in which
      they're received. A response object will be returned for each

      sent activity. For `message` activities this will contain the id of the
      delivered message.


      Instead of calling these methods directly on the adapter, calling
      `TurnContext.sendActivities()` or `TurnContext.sendActivity()`

      is the preferred way of sending activities as that will ensure that
      outgoing activities have been properly addressed

      and that any interested middleware has been notified.


      The primary scenario for calling this method directly is when you want to
      explicitly bypass

      going through any middleware. For instance, sending the `typing` activity
      might

      be a good reason to call this method directly as those activities are
      unlikely to require

      handling by middleware.

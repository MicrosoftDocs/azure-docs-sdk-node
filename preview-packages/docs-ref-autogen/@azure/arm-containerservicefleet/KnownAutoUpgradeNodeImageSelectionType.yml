      The image versions to upgrade nodes to are selected as described below:
      for each node pool in managed clusters affected by the update run, the
      system selects the latest image version such that it is available across
      all other node pools (in all other clusters) of the same image type. As a
      result, all node pools of the same image type will be upgraded to the same
      image version. For example, if the latest image version for image type
      'AKSUbuntu-1804gen2containerd' is
      'AKSUbuntu-1804gen2containerd-2021.10.12' for a node pool in cluster A in
      region X, and is 'AKSUbuntu-1804gen2containerd-2021.10.17' for a node pool
      in cluster B in region Y, the system will upgrade both node pools to image
      version 'AKSUbuntu-1804gen2containerd-2021.10.12'.

      Use the latest image version when upgrading nodes. Clusters may use
      different image versions (e.g., 'AKSUbuntu-1804gen2containerd-2021.10.12'
      and 'AKSUbuntu-1804gen2containerd-2021.10.19') because, for example, the
      latest available version is different in different regions.

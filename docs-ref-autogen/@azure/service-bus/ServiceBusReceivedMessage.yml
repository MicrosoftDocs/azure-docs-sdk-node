      The sequence number is a unique 64-bit integer assigned to a message as it

      partitioned entities,

      the topmost 16 bits reflect the partition identifier. Sequence numbers
      monotonically increase.

      They roll over to 0 when the 48-64 bit range is exhausted.


      **Max safe integer** that Javascript currently supports is `2^53 - 1`. The
      sequence number

      is an AMQP `Long` type which can be upto 64 bits long. To represent that
      we are using a

      library named [long.js](https://github.com/dcodeIO/long.js). We expect
      customers

      to use the **`Long`** type exported by this library.

      Whether Tasks in this job can be preempted by other high priority jobs.
      (This property is not available by default. Please contact support for
      more information) If the value is set to True, other high priority jobs
      submitted to the system will take precedence and will be able requeue
      tasks from this job. You can update a job's allowTaskPreemption after it
      has been created using the update job API.

      The action the Batch service should take when all Tasks in the Job are in
      the completed state. If omitted, the completion behavior is left
      unchanged. You may not change the value from terminatejob to noaction -
      that is, once you have engaged automatic Job termination, you cannot turn
      it off again. If you try to do this, the request fails with an 'invalid
      property value' error response; if you are calling the REST API directly,
      the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request).

      The maximum number of tasks that can be executed in parallel for the job.
      (This property is not available by default. Please contact support for
      more information) The value of maxParallelTasks must be -1 or greater than
      0 if specified. If not specified, the default value is -1, which means
      there's no limit to the number of tasks that can be run at once. You can
      update a job's maxParallelTasks after it has been created using the update
      job API.

      the Pool for a Job only when the Job is disabled. The Patch Job call will
      fail if you include the poolInfo element and the Job is not disabled. If
      you specify an autoPoolSpecification in the poolInfo, only the keepAlive
      property of the autoPoolSpecification can be updated, and then only if the
      autoPoolSpecification has a poolLifetimeOption of Job (other job
      properties can be updated as normal). If omitted, the Job continues to run
      on its current Pool.

summary: >-
  A function to be called each time a response is received from the server

  while performing the requested operation.

  May be called multiple times.


  This callback will be called with two parameters: the raw response, including
  headers and response body; and an error

  object which will be provided if an error was thrown while processing the
  request.

  The third __legacyError parameter is provided for backwards compatability only
  and will have an identical value to the `error` parameter.

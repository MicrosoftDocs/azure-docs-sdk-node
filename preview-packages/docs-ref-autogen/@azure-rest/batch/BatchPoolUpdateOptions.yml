      A list of Packages to be installed on each Compute Node in the Pool.
      Changes to Package references affect all new Nodes joining the Pool, but
      do not affect Compute Nodes that are already in the Pool until they are
      rebooted or reimaged. If this element is present, it replaces any existing
      Package references. If you specify an empty collection, then all Package
      references are removed from the Pool. If omitted, any existing Package
      references are left unchanged.

    summary: >-
      If this element is present, it replaces any existing Certificate
      references configured on the Pool.

      If omitted, any existing Certificate references are left unchanged.

      For Windows Nodes, the Batch service installs the Certificates to the
      specified Certificate store and location.

      For Linux Compute Nodes, the Certificates are stored in a directory inside
      the Task working directory and an environment variable
      AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the Task to query for this
      location.

      For Certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs' directory is
      created in the user's home directory (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and
      Certificates are placed in that directory.

      Warning: This property is deprecated and will be removed after February,
      2024. Please use the [Azure KeyVault
      Extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/batch/batch-certificate-migration-guide)
      instead.

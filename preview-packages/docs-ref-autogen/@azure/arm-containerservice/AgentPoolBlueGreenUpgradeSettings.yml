      The soak duration after draining a batch of nodes, i.e., the amount of
      time (in minutes) to wait after draining a batch of nodes before moving on
      the next batch. If not specified, the default is 15 minutes.

    summary: >-
      The number or percentage of nodes to drain in batch during blue-green
      upgrade. Must be a non-zero number. This can either be set to an integer
      (e.g. '5') or a percentage (e.g. '50%'). If a percentage is specified, it
      is the percentage of the total number of blue nodes of the initial upgrade
      operation. For percentages, fractional nodes are rounded up. If not
      specified, the default is 10%. For more information, including best
      practices, see:

    package: '@azure/arm-containerservice'
    summary: >-
      The drain timeout for a node, i.e., the amount of time (in minutes) to
      wait on eviction of pods and graceful termination per node. This eviction
      wait time honors waiting on pod disruption budgets. If this time is
      exceeded, the upgrade fails. If not specified, the default is 30 minutes.

      The soak duration for a node pool, i.e., the amount of time (in minutes)
      to wait after all old nodes are drained before we remove the old nodes. If
      not specified, the default is 60 minutes. Only applicable for blue-green
      upgrade strategy.

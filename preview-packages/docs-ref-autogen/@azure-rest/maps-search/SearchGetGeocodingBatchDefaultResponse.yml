  **Geocoding Batch API**



  **Applies to**: see pricing [tiers](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPricingTier).




  The Geocoding Batch API sends batches of queries to [Geocoding
  API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search-v2/get-geocoding) using
  just a single API call. The API allows caller to batch up to **100** queries.


  ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request

  The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the
  service receives a request, it will respond as soon as the batch items are
  calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later. The
  Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request
  takes longer than 60 seconds. The number of batch items is limited to **100**
  for this API.

  ```

  POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/geocode:batch?api-version=2023-06-01

  ```

  ### POST Body for Batch Request

  To send the _geocoding_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the
  request body will contain the `batchItems` array in `json` format and the
  `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a sample
  request body containing 2 _geocoding_ queries:



  ```

  {
    "batchItems": [
      {
        "addressLine": "One, Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052",
        "top": 2
      },
      {
        "addressLine": "Pike Pl",
        "adminDistrict": "WA",
        "locality": "Seattle",
        "top": 3
      }
    ]
  }

  ```


  A _geocoding_ batchItem object can accept any of the supported _geocoding_
  [URI
  parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search-v2/get-geocoding#uri-parameters).



  The batch should contain at least **1** query.



  ### Batch Response Model

  The batch response contains a `summary` component that indicates the
  `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request and
  `successfulRequests` i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch
  response also includes a `batchItems` array which contains a response for each
  and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will contain the
  results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch
  request. Each item is of one of the following types:

    - [`GeocodingResponse`](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search-v2/get-geocoding#geocodingresponse) - If the query completed successfully.

    - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.

      Enable advanced network policies. This allows users to configure Layer 7
      network policies (FQDN, HTTP, Kafka). Policies themselves must be
      configured via the Cilium Network Policy resources, see
      https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/security/policy/index.html. This can be
      enabled only on cilium-based clusters. If not specified, the default value
      is FQDN if security.enabled is set to true.

      This is the size of the candidate list of approximate neighbors stored
      while building the DiskANN index as part of the optimization processes.
      Large values may improve recall at the expense of latency. This is only
      applicable for the diskANN vector index type.

      The number of bytes used in product quantization of the vectors. A larger
      value may result in better recall for vector searches at the expense of
      latency. This is only applicable for the quantizedFlat and diskANN vector
      index types.

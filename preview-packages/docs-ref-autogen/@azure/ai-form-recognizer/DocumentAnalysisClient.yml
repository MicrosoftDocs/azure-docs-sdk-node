summary: >
  A client for interacting with the Form Recognizer service's analysis features.

  ### Examples:


  The Form Recognizer service and clients support two means of authentication:


  #### Azure Active Directory


  ```javascript

  import { DocumentAnalysisClient } from "@azure/ai-form-recognizer";

  import { DefaultAzureCredential } from "@azure/identity";


  const endpoint = "https://<resource name>.cognitiveservices.azure.com";

  const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();


  const client = new DocumentAnalysisClient(endpoint, credential);

  ```


  #### API Key (Subscription Key)


  ```javascript

  import { DocumentAnalysisClient, AzureKeyCredential } from
  "@azure/ai-form-recognizer";


  const endpoint = "https://<resource name>.cognitiveservices.azure.com";

  const credential = new AzureKeyCredential("<api key>");


  const client = new DocumentAnalysisClient(endpoint, credential);

  ```

      beginAnalyzeDocuments(string, string | FormRecognizerRequestBody,
      AnalyzeDocumentsOptions)
    uid: '@azure/ai-form-recognizer.DocumentAnalysisClient.beginAnalyzeDocuments'
    package: '@azure/ai-form-recognizer'
    summary: >+
      Extract data from an input using a model given by its unique ID.

      This operation supports custom as well as prebuilt models. For example, to
      use the prebuilt invoice model, provide

      the model ID "prebuilt-invoice", or to use the simpler prebuilt layout
      model, provide the model ID

      "prebuilt-layout".


      The fields produced in the `AnalyzeResponse` depend on the model that is
      used for analysis, and the values in any

      extracted documents' fields depend on the document types in the model (if
      any) and their corresponding field

      schemas.


      ### Examples


      This method supports both URLs (string) and streamable request bodies
      (<xref:FormRecognizerRequestBody>) such as

      Node.JS `ReadableStream` objects, browser `Blob`s, and `ArrayBuffer`s.


      #### From URL


      The Form Recognizer service will attempt to download a file using the
      submitted URL, so the URL must be accessible

      from the public internet. For example, a SAS token can be used to grant
      read access to a blob in Azure Storage, and

      the service will use the SAS-encoded URL to request the file.


      ```javascript

      // the URL must be publicly accessible

      const url = "<receipt document url>";


      // The model that is passed to the following function call determines the
      type of the eventual result. In the

      // example, we will use the prebuilt receipt model, but you could use a
      custom model ID/name instead.

      const poller = await client.beginAnalyzeDocuments("prebuilt-receipt",
      url);


      // The result is a long-running operation (poller), which must itself be
      polled until the operation completes

      const {
        pages, // pages extracted from the document, which contain lines and words
        tables, // extracted tables, organized into cells that contain their contents
        styles, // text styles (ex. handwriting) that were observed in the document
        keyValuePairs, // extracted pairs of elements  (directed associations from one element in the input to another)
        entities, // extracted entities in the input's content, which are categorized (ex. "Location" or "Organization")
        documents // extracted documents (instances of one of the model's document types and its field schema)
      } = await poller.pollUntilDone();


      // Extract the fields of the first document. These fields constitute a
      receipt, because we used the receipt model

      const [{ fields: receipt }] = documents;


      // The fields correspond to the model's document types and their field
      schemas. Refer to the Form Recognizer

      // documentation for information about the document types and field
      schemas within a model, or use the `getModel`

      // operation to view this information programmatically.

      console.log("The type of this receipt is:",
      receipt?.["ReceiptType"]?.value);

      ```


      #### From Request Body


      Alternatively, if the file is local (or in memory in the browser), a
      binary object can be uploaded. The following

      example uses the Node.JS filesystem API.


      ```javascript

      import * as fs from "fs";


      const file = fs.createReadStream("path/to/receipt.pdf");


      // The model that is passed to the following function call determines the
      type of the eventual result. In the

      // example, we will use the prebuilt receipt model, but you could use a
      custom model ID/name instead.

      const poller = await client.beginAnalyzeDocuments("prebuilt-receipt",
      file);


      // The result is a long-running operation (poller), which must itself be
      polled until the operation completes

      const {
        pages, // pages extracted from the document, which contain lines and words
        tables, // extracted tables, organized into cells that contain their contents
        styles, // text styles (ex. handwriting) that were observed in the document
        keyValuePairs, // extracted pairs of elements  (directed associations from one element in the input to another)
        entities, // extracted entities in the input's content, which are categorized (ex. "Location" or "Organization")
        documents // extracted documents (instances of one of the model's document types and its field schema)
      } = await poller.pollUntilDone();


      // Extract the fields of the first document. These fields constitute a
      receipt, because we used the receipt model

      const [{ fields: receipt }] = documents;


      // The fields correspond to the model's document types and their field
      schemas. Refer to the Form Recognizer

      // documentation for information about the document types and field
      schemas within a model, or use the `getModel`

      // operation to view this information programmatically.

      console.log("The type of this receipt is:",
      receipt?.["ReceiptType"]?.value);

    summary: >
      Extract data from an input using a model that has a known, strongly-typed
      document schema (a `DocumentModel`). It

      is not currently possible to define a custom `DocumentModel` instance in
      the SDK, so only the models that are

      provided as part of `PrebuiltModels` can be used with this method
      overload.

      See <xref:PrebuiltModels>.


      The fields produced in the `AnalyzeResponse` depend on the model that is
      used for analysis. In TypeScript, the type

      of the result for this method overload is inferred from the type of the
      input `DocumentModel`.


      ### Examples


      This method supports both URLs (string) and streamable request bodies
      (<xref:FormRecognizerRequestBody>) such as

      Node.JS `ReadableStream` objects, browser `Blob`s, and `ArrayBuffer`s.

      the service will use the SAS-encoded URL to request the file.


      ```javascript

      import { PrebuiltModels } from "@azure/ai-form-recognizer";


      // the URL must be publicly accessible

      const url = "<receipt document url>";


      // The model that is passed to the following function call determines the
      type of the eventual result. In the

      // example, we will use the prebuilt receipt model.

      const poller = await client.beginAnalyzeDocuments(PrebuiltModels.Receipt,
      url);


      // The result is a long-running operation (poller), which must itself be
      polled until the operation completes

      const {
        pages, // pages extracted from the document, which contain lines and words
        tables, // extracted tables, organized into cells that contain their contents
        styles, // text styles (ex. handwriting) that were observed in the document
        keyValuePairs, // extracted pairs of elements  (directed associations from one element in the input to another)
        entities, // extracted entities in the input's content, which are categorized (ex. "Location" or "Organization")

        documents // extracted documents (instances of one of the model's document types and its field schema)
      } = await poller.pollUntilDone();


      // Extract the fields of the first document. These fields constitute a
      receipt, because we used the receipt model

      const [{ fields: receipt }] = documents;


      // Since we used the strongly-typed PrebuiltModels.Receipt object instead
      of the "prebuilt-receipt" model ID

      // string, the fields of the receipt are strongly-typed and have camelCase
      names (as opposed to PascalCase).

      console.log("The type of this receipt is:", receipt.receiptType?.value);

      ```

  The response body contains the status of the specified asynchronous operation,
  indicating whether it has succeeded, is in progress, or has failed. Note that
  this status is distinct from the HTTP status code returned for the Get

  the asynchronous operation failed, the response body includes the HTTP status
  code for the failed request and error information regarding the failure.

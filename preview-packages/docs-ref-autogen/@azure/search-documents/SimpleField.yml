      A value indicating whether to enable the field to be referenced in facet
      queries. Typically

      used in a presentation of search results that includes hit count by
      category (for example,

      search for digital cameras and see hits by brand, by megapixels, by price,
      and so on).

      Fields of type Edm.GeographyPoint or Collection(Edm.GeographyPoint) cannot
      be facetable.

      Default is false for all other simple fields.

      `filterable` differs from `searchable` in how strings are handled. Fields
      of type Edm.String or

      Collection(Edm.String) that are filterable do not undergo word-breaking,
      so comparisons are for

      exact matches only. For example, if you set such a field f to "sunny day",
      $filter=f eq 'sunny'

      will find no matches, but $filter=f eq 'sunny day' will. Default is false.

      You can disable this

      option if you want to use a field (for example, margin) as a filter,
      sorting, or scoring

      mechanism but do not want the field to be visible to the end user. This
      property must be false

      for key fields. This property can be changed on existing fields. Enabling
      this property does

      not cause any increase in index storage requirements. Default is true for
      vector fields, false

      otherwise.

    summary: >-
      A value indicating whether the field is full-text searchable. This means
      it will undergo

      analysis such as word-breaking during indexing. If you set a searchable
      field to a value like

      "sunny day", internally it will be split into the individual tokens
      "sunny" and "day". This

      enables full-text searches for these terms. Fields of type Edm.String or
      Collection(Edm.String)

      are searchable by default. This property must be false for simple

      fields of other non-string data types.

      Note: searchable fields consume extra space in your index to accommodate
      additional tokenized

      versions of the field value for full-text searches. If you want to save
      space in your index and

      you don't need a field to be included in searches, set searchable to
      false. Default is false.

      A value indicating whether to enable the field to be referenced in
      $orderby expressions. By

      default, the service sorts results by score, but in many experiences users
      will want

      to sort by fields in the documents. A simple field can be sortable only if
      it is single-valued

      (it has a single value in the scope of the parent document). Simple
      collection fields cannot

      be sortable, since they are multi-valued. Simple sub-fields of complex
      collections are also

      multi-valued, and therefore cannot be sortable. This is true whether it's
      an immediate parent

      field, or an ancestor field, that's the complex collection. The default is
      false.

      fields, and for

      non-vector fields, and it must be null for complex fields. Disabling this

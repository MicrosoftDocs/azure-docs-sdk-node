    summary: >-
      This Boolean is used to specify the creation mechanism for 'all' the Event
      Grid Domain Topics

      associated with this Event Grid Domain resource.

      In this context, creation of domain topic can be auto-managed (when true)
      or self-managed

      (when false). The default value for this property is true.

      When this property is null or set to true, Event Grid is responsible of
      automatically creating

      the domain topic when the first event subscription is

      created at the scope of the domain topic. If this property is set to
      false, then creating the

      first event subscription will require creating a domain topic

      by the user. The self-management mode can be used if the user wants full
      control of when the

      domain topic is created, while auto-managed mode provides the

      flexibility to perform less operations and manage fewer resources by the
      user. Also, note that

      in auto-managed creation mode, user is allowed to create the

      domain topic on demand if needed. Default value: true.

      This Boolean is used to specify the deletion mechanism for 'all' the Event
      Grid Domain Topics

      associated with this Event Grid Domain resource.

      In this context, deletion of domain topic can be auto-managed (when true)
      or self-managed

      (when false). The default value for this property is true.

      When this property is set to true, Event Grid is responsible of
      automatically deleting the

      domain topic when the last event subscription at the scope

      of the domain topic is deleted. If this property is set to false, then the
      user needs to

      manually delete the domain topic when it is no longer needed

      (e.g., when last event subscription is deleted and the resource needs to
      be cleaned up). The

      self-management mode can be used if the user wants full

      control of when the domain topic needs to be deleted, while auto-managed
      mode provides the

      flexibility to perform less operations and manage fewer

      resources by the user. Default value: true.

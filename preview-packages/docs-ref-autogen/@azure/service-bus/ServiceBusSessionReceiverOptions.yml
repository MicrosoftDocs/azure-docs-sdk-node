      The maximum duration, in milliseconds, that the lock on the session will
      be renewed automatically by the client.


      - **Default**: `300000` milliseconds (5 minutes).

      - **To disable autolock renewal**, set this to `0`.


      **Example:**

         If the lock expires in 2 minutes and your processing time is 8 minutes...

         Set maxAutoLockRenewalDurationInMs to 10 minutes, and the lock will be automatically renewed about 4 times
         (equivalent to having the session locked for 4 times its lock duration by leveraging the lock renewals).

      Represents the receive mode for the receiver.


      In receiveAndDelete mode, messages are deleted from Service Bus as they
      are received.


      In peekLock mode, the receiver has a lock on the message for the duration
      specified on the

      queue/subscription.


      Messages that are not settled within the lock duration will be redelivered
      as many times as

      the max delivery count set on the queue/subscription, after which they get
      sent to a separate

      dead letter queue.


      You can settle a message by calling complete(), abandon(), defer() or
      deadletter() methods on

      the message.

      A description of an encryption key that you create in Azure Key Vault.
      This key is used to provide an additional level of encryption-at-rest for
      your agent definition when you want full assurance that no one, not even
      Microsoft, can decrypt them. Once you have encrypted your agent
      definition, it will always remain encrypted. The search service will
      ignore attempts to set this property to null. You can change this property
      as needed if you want to rotate your encryption key; Your agent definition
      will be unaffected. Encryption with customer-managed keys is not available
      for free search services, and is only available for paid services created
      on or after January 1, 2019.

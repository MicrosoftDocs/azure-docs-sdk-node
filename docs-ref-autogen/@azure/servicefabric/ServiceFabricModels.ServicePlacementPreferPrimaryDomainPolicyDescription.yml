  Describes the policy to be used for placement of a Service Fabric service
  where the service's

  Primary replicas should optimally be placed in a particular domain.


  This placement policy is usually used with fault domains in scenarios where
  the Service Fabric

  cluster is geographically distributed in order to indicate that a service's
  primary replica

  should be located in a particular fault domain, which in geo-distributed
  scenarios usually

  aligns with regional or datacenter boundaries. Note that since this is an
  optimization it is

  possible that the Primary replica may not end up located in this domain due to
  failures,

  capacity limits, or other constraints.

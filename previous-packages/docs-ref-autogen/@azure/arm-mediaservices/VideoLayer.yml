      The frame rate (in frames per second) at which to encode this layer. The
      value can be in the form of M/N where M and N are integers (For example,
      30000/1001), or in the form of a number (For example, 30, or 29.97). The
      encoder enforces constraints on allowed frame rates based on the profile
      and level. If it is not specified, the encoder will use the same frame
      rate as the input video.

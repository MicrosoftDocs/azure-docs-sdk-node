      The Batch service supports two ways to control the work done as part of a
      Job.

      In the first approach, the user specifies a Job Manager Task. The Batch
      service

      launches this Task when it is ready to start the Job. The Job Manager Task

      controls all other Tasks that run under this Job, by using the Task APIs.
      In

      the second approach, the user directly controls the execution of Tasks
      under an

      active Job, by using the Task APIs. Also note: when naming Jobs, avoid

      including sensitive information such as user names or secret project
      names.

      This information may appear in telemetry logs accessible to Microsoft
      Support

      engineers.

      Note that each Task must have a unique ID. The Batch service may not
      return the

      results for each Task in the same order the Tasks were submitted in this

      request. If the server times out or the connection is closed during the

      request, the request may have been partially or fully processed, or not at
      all.

      In such cases, the user should re-issue the request. Note that it is up to
      the

      user to correctly handle failures when re-issuing a request. For example,
      you

      should use the same Task IDs during a retry so that if the prior operation

      succeeded, the retry will not create extra Tasks unexpectedly. If the
      response

      contains any Tasks which failed to add, a client can retry the request. In
      a

      retry, it is most efficient to resubmit only Tasks that failed to add, and
      to

      omit Tasks that were successfully added on the first attempt. The maximum

      lifetime of a Task from addition to completion is 180 days. If a Task has
      not

      completed within 180 days of being added it will be terminated by the
      Batch

      service and left in whatever state it was in at that time.

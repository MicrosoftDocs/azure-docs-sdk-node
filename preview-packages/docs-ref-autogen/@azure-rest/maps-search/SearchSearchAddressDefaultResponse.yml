  **Address Geocoding**

  **Applies to:** see pricing [tiers](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPricingTier).


  In many cases, the complete search service might be too much, for instance if
  you are only interested in traditional geocoding. Search can also be accessed
  for address look up exclusively. The geocoding is performed by hitting the
  geocode endpoint with just the address or partial address in question. The
  geocoding search index will be queried for everything above the street level
  data. No POIs will be returned. Note that the geocoder is very tolerant of
  typos and incomplete addresses. It will also handle everything from exact
  street addresses or street or intersections as well as higher level
  geographies such as city centers, counties, states etc.

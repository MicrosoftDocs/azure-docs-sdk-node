  - name: AACGoodQualityAudio
    uid: '@azure/arm-mediaservices.KnownEncoderNamedPreset.AACGoodQualityAudio'
    package: '@azure/arm-mediaservices'
    summary: >-
      Produces a single MP4 file containing only AAC stereo audio encoded at 192
      kbps.
  - name: AdaptiveStreaming
    uid: '@azure/arm-mediaservices.KnownEncoderNamedPreset.AdaptiveStreaming'
    package: '@azure/arm-mediaservices'
    summary: >-
      Produces a set of GOP aligned MP4 files with H.264 video and stereo AAC
      audio. Auto-generates a bitrate ladder based on the input resolution,
      bitrate and frame rate. The auto-generated preset will never exceed the
      input resolution. For example, if the input is 720p, output will remain
      720p at best.
  - name: ContentAwareEncoding
    uid: '@azure/arm-mediaservices.KnownEncoderNamedPreset.ContentAwareEncoding'
    package: '@azure/arm-mediaservices'
    summary: >-
      Produces a set of GOP-aligned MP4s by using content-aware encoding. Given
      any input content, the service performs an initial lightweight analysis of
      the input content, and uses the results to determine the optimal number of
      layers, appropriate bitrate and resolution settings for delivery by
      adaptive streaming. This preset is particularly effective for low and
      medium complexity videos, where the output files will be at lower bitrates
      but at a quality that still delivers a good experience to viewers. The
      output will contain MP4 files with video and audio interleaved.
  - name: ContentAwareEncodingExperimental
    uid: >-
      @azure/arm-mediaservices.KnownEncoderNamedPreset.ContentAwareEncodingExperimental
    package: '@azure/arm-mediaservices'
    summary: >-
      Exposes an experimental preset for content-aware encoding. Given any input
      content, the service attempts to automatically determine the optimal
      number of layers, appropriate bitrate and resolution settings for delivery
      by adaptive streaming. The underlying algorithms will continue to evolve
      over time. The output will contain MP4 files with video and audio
      interleaved.
  - name: CopyAllBitrateNonInterleaved
    uid: >-
      @azure/arm-mediaservices.KnownEncoderNamedPreset.CopyAllBitrateNonInterleaved
    package: '@azure/arm-mediaservices'
    summary: >-
      Copy all video and audio streams from the input asset as non-interleaved
      video and audio output files. This preset can be used to clip an existing
      asset or convert a group of key frame (GOP) aligned MP4 files as an asset
      that can be streamed.

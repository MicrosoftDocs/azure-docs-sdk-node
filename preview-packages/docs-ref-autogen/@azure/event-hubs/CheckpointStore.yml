    summary: >
      A checkpoint store stores and retrieves partition ownership information
      and checkpoint details

      for each partition in a given consumer group of an event hub instance.

      Users are not meant to implement an `CheckpointStore`.

      Users are expected to choose existing implementations of this interface,
      instantiate it, and pass

      it to the constructor of `EventProcessor`.


      To get started, you can use the `InMemoryCheckpointStore` which will store
      the relevant information in memory.

      But in production, you should choose an implementation of the
      `CheckpointStore` interface that will

      store the checkpoints and partition ownerships to a durable store instead.


      Implementations of `CheckpointStore` can be found on npm by searching for
      packages with the prefix &commat;azure/eventhub-checkpointstore-.

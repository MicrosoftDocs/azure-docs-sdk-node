      Get list of machines that assessed as part of the specified assessment.
      Returns a json array of

      objects of type 'assessedMachine' as specified in the Models section.


      Whenever an assessment is created or updated, it goes under computation.
      During this phase, the

      'status' field of Assessment object reports 'Computing'.

      During the period when the assessment is under computation, the list of
      assessed machines is empty

      and no assessed machines are returned by this call.

summary: >-
  The `Get Route Directions` API is an HTTP `GET` request that returns a route
  between an origin and a destination, passing through waypoints if specified.
  The route takes into account factors such as current traffic and the typical
  road speeds on the requested day of the week and time of day.


  Information returned includes the distance, estimated travel time, and a
  representation of the route geometry. Additional routing information such as
  optimized waypoint order or turn by turn instructions is also available,
  depending on the options selected.


  Routing service provides a set of parameters for a detailed description of a
  vehicle-specific consumption model. For more information, see [Consumption
  Model](/azure/azure-maps/consumption-model).

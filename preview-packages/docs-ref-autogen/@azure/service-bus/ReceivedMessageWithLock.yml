    summary: >-
      The partition key for sending a message into an entity

      via a partitioned transfer queue. Maximum length is 128 characters. If a
      message is sent via a

      transfer queue in the scope of a transaction, this value selects the
      transfer queue partition:

      This is functionally equivalent to `partitionKey` property and ensures
      that messages are kept

      together and in order as they are transferred.

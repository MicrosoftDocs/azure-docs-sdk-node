name: KnownAutoGeneratedDomainNameLabelScope

package: '@azure/arm-servicefabricmanagedclusters'
summary: >-
  This enum is the entrypoint to using a certificate from a public CA for your
  cluster. This property was introduced to solve the

  domain squatting problem with new domains. A domain name will be generated in
  the following format: {clustername}.{hash}.{regionname}.sfmcdomain.

  The hash portion comes from Azure DNS' Deterministic Name Library. The library
  creates a hash using the cluster's Tenant, Subscription, Resource Group

  and Resource Name using the AutoGeneratedDomainNameLabelScope/reuse policy
  chosen.

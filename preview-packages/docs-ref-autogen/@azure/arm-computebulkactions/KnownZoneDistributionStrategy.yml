      Balance launching instances across zones specified based on best effort.
          If capacity is not available, LaunchBulkInstancesOperation can deviate balancing across all zones.

    summary: |-
      Default. Launch instances in a single zone based on best effort.
          If capacity is not available, LaunchBulkInstancesOperation can allocate capacity in different zones.

    summary: |-
      Launch instances based on zone preferences.
          Higher priority zones are filled first before allocating to lower priority zones.

    summary: >-
      Launch instances across all provided zones, ensuring the difference
      between any two zones is no more than one instance.

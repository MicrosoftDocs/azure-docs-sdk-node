    summary: >-
      This parameter defines how long (in seconds) the soft shutdown waits until
      the RFC/HTTP clients no longer consider the server for calls with load
      balancing. Value 0 means that the kernel does not wait, but goes directly
      into the next shutdown state, i.e. hard stop.

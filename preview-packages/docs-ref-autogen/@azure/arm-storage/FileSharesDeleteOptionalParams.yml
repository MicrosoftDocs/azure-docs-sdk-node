      Optional. Valid values are: snapshots, leased-snapshots, none. The default
      value is snapshots. For 'snapshots', the file share is deleted including
      all of its file share snapshots. If the file share contains
      leased-snapshots, the deletion fails. For 'leased-snapshots', the file
      share is deleted included all of its file share snapshots
      (leased/unleased). For 'none', the file share is deleted if it has no
      share snapshots. If the file share contains any snapshots (leased or
      unleased), the deletion fails.

  The node image upgrade type. \

  [KnownAutoUpgradeNodeImageSelectionType](xref:@azure/arm-containerservicefleet.KnownAutoUpgradeNodeImageSelectionType)
  can be used interchangeably with AutoUpgradeNodeImageSelectionType,
   this enum contains the known values that the service supports.
  ### Known values supported by the service

  **Latest**: Use the latest image version when upgrading nodes. Clusters may
  use different image versions (e.g., 'AKSUbuntu-1804gen2containerd-2021.10.12'
  and 'AKSUbuntu-1804gen2containerd-2021.10.19') because, for example, the
  latest available version is different in different regions. \

  **Consistent**: The image versions to upgrade nodes to are selected as
  described below: for each node pool in managed clusters affected by the update
  run, the system selects the latest image version such that it is available
  across all other node pools (in all other clusters) of the same image type. As
  a result, all node pools of the same image type will be upgraded to the same
  image version. For example, if the latest image version for image type
  'AKSUbuntu-1804gen2containerd' is 'AKSUbuntu-1804gen2containerd-2021.10.12'
  for a node pool in cluster A in region X, and is
  'AKSUbuntu-1804gen2containerd-2021.10.17' for a node pool in cluster B in
  region Y, the system will upgrade both node pools to image version
  'AKSUbuntu-1804gen2containerd-2021.10.12'.

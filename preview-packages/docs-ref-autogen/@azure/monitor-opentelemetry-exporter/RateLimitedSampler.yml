  RateLimitedSampler is responsible for the following:

  - Implements a rate-limiting sampling strategy based on a specified number of
  requests per second.

  - Dynamically adjusts the sampling rate based on the time elapsed since the
  last sample.

  - Provides a sampling rate that can be used to determine whether a span should
  be recorded.

    summary: >-
      Gets the current sample rate based on the effective window count and
      nanos.

      This method calculates the sampling probability and returns it as a
      percentage.

      If `roundToNearest` is true, it rounds down the sampling percentage to the
      nearest whole number.

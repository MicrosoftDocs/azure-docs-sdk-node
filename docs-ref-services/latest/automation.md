# Azure Automation Modules for JavaScript

## Overview

Azure Automation provides a way for users to automate the manual, long-running, error-prone, and frequently repeated tasks that are commonly performed in a cloud and enterprise environment. Automation saves time and increases the reliability of regular administrative tasks and even schedules them to be automatically performed at regular intervals. You can automate processes using runbooks or automate configuration management using Desired State Configuration.

## Management package

Use npm to install the Azure Automation modules for JavaScript

npm install @azure/arm-automation

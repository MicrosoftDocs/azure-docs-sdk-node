      The URL of the container within Azure Blob Storage to which to upload the
      Batch Service log

      file(s). The URL must include a Shared Access Signature (SAS) granting

      finish. The start

      time for SAS is optional and recommended to not be specified.

      The end of the time range from which to upload Batch Service log file(s).
      Any log file

      containing a log message in the time range will be uploaded. This means
      that the operation

      might retrieve more logs than have been requested since the entire log
      file is always

      uploaded, but the operation should not retrieve fewer logs than have been
      requested. If

      omitted, the default is to upload all logs available after the startTime.

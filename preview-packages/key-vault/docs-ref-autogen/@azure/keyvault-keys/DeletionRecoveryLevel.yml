  **Purgeable**: Denotes a vault state in which deletion is an irreversible
  operation, without the possibility for recovery. This level corresponds to no
  protection being available against a Delete operation; the data is
  irretrievably lost upon accepting a Delete operation at the entity level or
  higher (vault, resource group, subscription etc.) \

  **Recoverable+Purgeable**: Denotes a vault state in which deletion is
  recoverable, and which also permits immediate and permanent deletion (i.e.
  purge). This level guarantees the recoverability of the deleted entity during
  the retention interval (90 days), unless a Purge operation is requested, or
  the subscription is cancelled. System wil permanently delete it after 90 days,
  if not recovered \

  **Recoverable**: Denotes a vault state in which deletion is recoverable
  without the possibility for immediate and permanent deletion (i.e. purge).
  This level guarantees the recoverability of the deleted entity during the
  retention interval(90 days) and while the subscription is still available.

  **Recoverable+ProtectedSubscription**: Denotes a vault and subscription state
  in which deletion is recoverable within retention interval (90 days),
  immediate and permanent deletion (i.e. purge) is not permitted, and in which
  the subscription itself  cannot be permanently canceled. System wil
  permanently delete it after 90 days, if not recovered \

  **CustomizedRecoverable+Purgeable**: Denotes a vault state in which deletion
  is recoverable, and which also permits immediate and permanent deletion (i.e.
  purge when 7<= SoftDeleteRetentionInDays < 90). This level guarantees the
  recoverability of the deleted entity during the retention interval, unless a
  Purge operation is requested, or the subscription is cancelled. \

  **CustomizedRecoverable**: Denotes a vault state in which deletion is
  recoverable without the possibility for immediate and permanent deletion (i.e.
  purge when 7<= SoftDeleteRetentionInDays < 90).This level guarantees the
  recoverability of the deleted entity during the retention interval and while

  subscription state in which deletion is recoverable, immediate and permanent
  deletion (i.e. purge) is not permitted, and in which the subscription itself
  cannot be permanently canceled when 7<= SoftDeleteRetentionInDays < 90. This

  interval, and also reflects the fact that the subscription itself cannot be

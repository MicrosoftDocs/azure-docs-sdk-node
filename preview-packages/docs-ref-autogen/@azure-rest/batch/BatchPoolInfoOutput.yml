    summary: >-
      Characteristics for a temporary 'auto pool'. The Batch service will create
      this auto Pool when the Job is submitted. If auto Pool creation fails, the
      Batch service moves the Job to a completed state, and the Pool creation
      error is set in the Job's scheduling error property. The Batch service
      manages the lifetime (both creation and, unless keepAlive is specified,
      deletion) of the auto Pool. Any user actions that affect the lifetime of
      the auto Pool while the Job is active will result in unexpected behavior.
      You must specify either the Pool ID or the auto Pool specification, but
      not both.

    summary: >-
      The ID of an existing Pool. All the Tasks of the Job will run on the
      specified Pool. You must ensure that the Pool referenced by this property
      exists. If the Pool does not exist at the time the Batch service tries to
      schedule a Job, no Tasks for the Job will run until you create a Pool with
      that id. Note that the Batch service will not reject the Job request; it
      will simply not run Tasks until the Pool exists. You must specify either
      the Pool ID or the auto Pool specification, but not both.

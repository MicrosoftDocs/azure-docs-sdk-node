    summary: "Specifies details of a Job Manager task.\r\rThe Job Manager task is automatically started when the job is created. The\rBatch service tries to schedule the Job Manager task before any other tasks\rin the job. When shrinking a pool, the Batch service tries to preserve\rcompute nodes where Job Manager tasks are running for as long as possible\r(that is, nodes running 'normal' tasks are removed before nodes running Job\rManager tasks). When a Job Manager task fails and needs to be restarted, the\rsystem tries to schedule it at the highest priority. If there are no idle\rnodes available, the system may terminate one of the running tasks in the\rpool and return it to the queue in order to make room for the Job Manager\rtask to restart. Note that a Job Manager task in one job does not have\rpriority over tasks in other jobs. Across jobs, only job level priorities\rare observed. For example, if a Job Manager in a priority 0 job needs to be\rrestarted, it will not displace tasks of a priority 1 job."

      If you try to delete a Certificate that is being used by a Pool or Compute

      Node, the status of the Certificate changes to deleteFailed. If you decide
      that

      you want to continue using the Certificate, you can use this operation to
      set

      the status of the Certificate back to active. If you intend to delete the

      Certificate, you do not need to run this operation after the deletion
      failed.

      You must make sure that the Certificate is not being used by any
      resources, and

      then you can try again to delete the Certificate.

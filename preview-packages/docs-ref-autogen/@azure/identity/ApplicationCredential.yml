  Provides a default <xref:ChainedTokenCredential> configuration that should
  work for most applications that use the Azure SDK.  The following credential
  types will be tried, in order:
  - <xref:EnvironmentCredential>
  - <xref:ManagedIdentityCredential>


  Consult the documentation of these credential types for more information
  on how they attempt authentication.

  Azure Identity extensions may add credential types to the default credential
  stack.

      Returns the first access token returned by one of the chained

      `TokenCredential` implementations.  Throws an
      <xref:AggregateAuthenticationError>

      when one or more credentials throws an <xref:AuthenticationError> and

      no credentials have returned an access token.

      This method is called automatically by Azure SDK client libraries. You may
      call this method

      directly, but you must also handle token caching and token refreshing.

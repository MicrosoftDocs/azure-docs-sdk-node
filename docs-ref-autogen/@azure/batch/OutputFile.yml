  On every file uploads, Batch service writes two log files to the compute node,

  'fileuploadout.txt' and 'fileuploaderr.txt'. These log files are used to learn
  more about a

  specific failure.

    package: '@azure/batch'
    summary: >-
      A pattern indicating which file(s) to upload. Both relative and absolute
      paths are supported.

      Relative paths are relative to the Task working directory. The following
      wildcards are

      supported: * matches 0 or more characters (for example pattern abc* would
      match abc or

      abcdef), ** matches any directory, ? matches any single character, [abc]
      matches one character

      in the brackets, and [a-c] matches one character in the range. Brackets
      can include a negation

      to match any character not specified (for example [!abc] matches any
      character but a, b, or

      c). If a file name starts with "." it is ignored by default but may be
      matched by specifying

      it explicitly (for example *.gif will not match .a.gif, but .*.gif will).
      A simple example:

      **\*.txt matches any file that does not start in '.' and ends with .txt in
      the Task working

      directory or any subdirectory. If the filename contains a wildcard
      character it can be escaped

      using brackets (for example abc[*] would match a file named abc*). Note
      that both \ and / are

      treated as directory separators on Windows, but only / is on Linux.
      Environment variables

      (%var% on Windows or $var on Linux) are expanded prior to the pattern
      being applied.

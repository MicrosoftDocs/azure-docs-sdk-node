      an error-space that is not known in this address space.  Also
      errors raised by APIs that do not return enough error information
      may be converted to this error.

    children: []
    langs:
      - typeScript
    summary: |
      Operation was rejected because the system is not in a state
      required for the operation's execution.  For example, directory
      to be deleted may be non-empty, an rmdir operation is applied to
      a non-directory, etc.
      A litmus test that may help a service implementor in deciding
      between FAILED_PRECONDITION, ABORTED, and UNAVAILABLE:

       - Use UNAVAILABLE if the client can retry just the failing call.
       - Use ABORTED if the client should retry at a higher-level
         (e.g., restarting a read-modify-write sequence).
       - Use FAILED_PRECONDITION if the client should not retry until
         the system state has been explicitly fixed.  E.g., if an "rmdir"
         fails because the directory is non-empty, FAILED_PRECONDITION
         should be returned since the client should not retry unless
         they have first fixed up the directory by deleting files from it.
       - Use FAILED_PRECONDITION if the client performs conditional
         REST Get/Update/Delete on a resource and the resource on the
         server does not match the condition. E.g., conflicting
         read-modify-write on the same resource.

    children: []
    langs:
      - typeScript
    summary: |
      Operation was attempted past the valid range.  E.g., seeking or
      reading past end of file.
      Unlike INVALID_ARGUMENT, this error indicates a problem that may
      be fixed if the system state changes. For example, a 32-bit file
      system will generate INVALID_ARGUMENT if asked to read at an
      offset that is not in the range [0,2^32-1], but it will generate
      OUT_OF_RANGE if asked to read from an offset past the current
      file size.

      There is a fair bit of overlap between FAILED_PRECONDITION and
      OUT_OF_RANGE.  We recommend using OUT_OF_RANGE (the more specific
      error) when it applies so that callers who are iterating through
      a space can easily look for an OUT_OF_RANGE error to detect when
      they are done.

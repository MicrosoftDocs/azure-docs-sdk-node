      A list of IP restriction rules that defines the inbound network(s) with
      allowing access to the search service endpoint. At the meantime, all other
      public IP networks are blocked by the firewall. These restriction rules
      are applied only when the 'publicNetworkAccess' of the search service is
      'enabled'; otherwise, traffic over public interface is not allowed even
      with any public IP rules, and private endpoint connections would be the
      exclusive access method.

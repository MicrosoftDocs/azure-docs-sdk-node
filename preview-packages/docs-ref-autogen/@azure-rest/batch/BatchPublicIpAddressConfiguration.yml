    summary: >-
      The list of public IPs which the Batch service will use when provisioning
      Compute Nodes. The number of IPs specified here limits the maximum size of
      the Pool - 100 dedicated nodes or 100 Spot/Low-priority nodes can be
      allocated for each public IP. For example, a pool needing 250 dedicated
      VMs would need at least 3 public IPs specified. Each element of this
      collection is of the form:
      /subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/{group}/providers/Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/{ip}.

      The IP families used to specify IP versions available to the pool. IP
      families are used to determine single-stack or dual-stack pools. For
      single-stack, the expected value is IPv4. For dual-stack, the expected
      values are IPv4 and IPv6.

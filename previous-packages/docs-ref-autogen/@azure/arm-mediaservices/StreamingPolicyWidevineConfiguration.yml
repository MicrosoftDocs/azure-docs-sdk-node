      Template for the URL of the custom service delivering licenses to end user
      players.  Not required when using Azure Media Services for issuing
      licenses.  The template supports replaceable tokens that the service will
      update at runtime with the value specific to the request.  The currently
      supported token values are {AlternativeMediaId}, which is replaced with
      the value of StreamingLocatorId.AlternativeMediaId, and {ContentKeyId},
      which is replaced with the value of identifier of the key being requested.

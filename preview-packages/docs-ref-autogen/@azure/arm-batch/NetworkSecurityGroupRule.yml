    summary: >-
      Priorities within a pool must be unique and are evaluated in order of
      priority. The lower the number the higher the priority. For example, rules
      could be specified with order numbers of 150, 250, and 350. The rule with
      the order number of 150 takes precedence over the rule that has an order
      of 250. Allowed priorities are 150 to 4096. If any reserved or duplicate
      values are provided the request fails with HTTP status code 400.

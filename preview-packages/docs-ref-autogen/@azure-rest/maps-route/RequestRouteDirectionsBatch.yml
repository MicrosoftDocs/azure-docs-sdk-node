      The `Get Route Directions Batch` API is an HTTP `GET` request that sends
      batches of queries to the [Get Route
      Directions](/rest/api/maps/route/get-route-directions) API using a single
      request. You can call `Get Route Directions Batch` API to run either
      asynchronously (async) or synchronously (sync). The async API allows
      caller to batch up to **700** queries and sync API up to **100** queries.


      ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results

      To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the
      batch download endpoint. This _download URL_ can be obtained from the
      `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
      following:


      ```

      https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&subscription-key={subscription-key}

      ```

      Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch
      results:

      1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.

      2. The server will respond with one of the following:

          > HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some time.

          > HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.



      ### Batch Response Model

      The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When
      downloading the results of an async batch request, if the batch has
      finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This
      batch response contains a `summary` component that indicates the
      `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request and
      `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The
      batch response also includes a `batchItems` array which contains a
      response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems`
      will contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were
      sent in the batch request. Each item in `batchItems` contains `statusCode`
      and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
      following types:

        - [`RouteDirections`](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections#routedirections) - If the query completed successfully.

        - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.


      Here's a sample Batch Response with 1 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:



      ```json

          "summary": {

    summary: >-
      The `Post Route Directions Batch` API is an HTTP `POST` request that sends
      batches of queries to the [Get Route
      Directions](/rest/api/maps/route/get-route-directions) API using a single
      asynchronous request. You can call `Route Directions Batch` API to run
      either asynchronously (async) or synchronously (sync). The async API
      allows caller to batch up to **700** queries and sync API up to **100**
      queries. To call the `Post Route Directions Batch` API in a synchronous
      request, see [Post Route Directions Batch
      Sync](/rest/api/maps/route/post-route-directions-batch-sync).


      ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request

      The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of
      relatively complex route requests

      - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple
      downloads are possible).

      - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to
      run into a timeout.

      - The number of batch items is limited to **700** for this API.


      When you make a request by using async request, by default the service
      returns a 202 response code along a redirect URL in the Location field of
      the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
      response data or error information is available.

      The asynchronous responses are stored for **24** hours. The redirect URL
      returns a 404 response if used after the expiration period.


      Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation.
      Here's a typical sequence of operations:

      1. Client sends a Route Directions Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.

      ```

      POST
      https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/batch/json?api-version=1.0&subscription-key={subscription-key}

      ```

      2. The server will respond with one of the following:

          > HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.

          > HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or any other `Error` status code.

      3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header
      in the response contains the URL to download the results of the batch
      request.
          This status URI looks like following:
      ```

      GET
      https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&subscription-key={subscription-key}

      ```

      4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3
      to download the batch results.


      ### POST Body for Batch Request

      To send the _route directions_ queries you will use a `POST` request where
      the request body will contain the `batchItems` array in `json` format and
      the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
      sample request body containing 3 _route directions_ queries:



      ```json

      {
          "batchItems": [
              { "query": "?query=47.620659,-122.348934:47.610101,-122.342015&travelMode=bicycle&routeType=eco&traffic=false" },
              { "query": "?query=40.759856,-73.985108:40.771136,-73.973506&travelMode=pedestrian&routeType=shortest" },
              { "query": "?query=48.923159,-122.557362:32.621279,-116.840362" }
          ]
      }

      ```


      A _route directions_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the
      protocol, base URL, path, api-version and subscription-key. It can accept
      any of the supported _route directions_ [URI
      parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections#uri-parameters).
      The string values in the _route directions_ query must be properly escaped
      (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\ ) and it should also be
      properly URL-encoded.



      The async API allows caller to batch up to **700** queries and sync API up
      to **100** queries, and the batch should contain at least **1** query.



      ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results

      To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the
      batch download endpoint. This _download URL_ can be obtained from the
      `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
      following:


      ```

      https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&subscription-key={subscription-key}

      ```

      Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch
      results:

      1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.

      2. The server will respond with one of the following:

          > HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some time.

          > HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.



      ### Batch Response Model

      The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When
      downloading the results of an async batch request, if the batch has
      finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This
      batch response contains a `summary` component that indicates the
      `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request and
      `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The
      batch response also includes a `batchItems` array which contains a
      response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems`
      will contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were
      sent in the batch request. Each item in `batchItems` contains `statusCode`
      and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
      following types:

        - [`RouteDirections`](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections#routedirections) - If the query completed successfully.

        - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.


      Here's a sample Batch Response with 1 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:



      ```json

      {
          "summary": {
              "successfulRequests": 1,

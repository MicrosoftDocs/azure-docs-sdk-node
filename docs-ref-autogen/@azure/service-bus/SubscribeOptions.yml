      Indicates whether the message should be settled using the
      `completeMessage()`

      method on the receiver automatically after it executes the user provided
      message callback.

      Doing so removes the message from the queue/subscription.


      This option is ignored if messages are received in the `receiveAndDelete`
      receive mode or if

      the message is already settled in the user provided message callback.

package: '@azure/arm-servicefabricmanagedclusters'
summary: >-
  This enum is the entrypoint to using a certificate from a public CA for your
  cluster. This property was introduced to solve the

  domain squatting problem with new domains. A domain name will be generated in
  the following format: {clustername}.{hash}.{regionname}.sfmcdomain.

  The hash portion comes from Azure DNS' Deterministic Name Library. The library
  creates a hash using the cluster's Tenant, Subscription, Resource Group

  and Resource Name using the AutoGeneratedDomainNameLabelScope/reuse policy
  chosen. \

  [KnownAutoGeneratedDomainNameLabelScope](xref:@azure/arm-servicefabricmanagedclusters.KnownAutoGeneratedDomainNameLabelScope)
  can be used interchangeably with AutoGeneratedDomainNameLabelScope,
   this enum contains the known values that the service supports.
  ### Known values supported by the service

  **TenantReuse**: TenantReuse allows for the same hash to be created if the
  resource is created in the same Tenant with the same resource name. \

  **SubscriptionReuse**: SubscriptionReuse allows for the same hash to be
  created if the resource is created in the same Subscription with the same
  resource name. \

  **ResourceGroupReuse**: ResourceGroupReuse allows for the same hash to be
  created if the resource is created in the same Resource Group with the same
  resource name. \

  **NoReuse**: NoReuse will create a new hash regardless of the Subscription,
  Resource Group, Tenant and Resource name.

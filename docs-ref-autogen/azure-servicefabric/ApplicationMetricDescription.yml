      The maximum node capacity for Service Fabric application.

      This is the maximum Load for an instance of this application on a single
      node. Even if the

      capacity of node is greater than this value, Service Fabric will limit the
      total load of

      services within the application on each node to this value.

      If set to zero, capacity for this metric is unlimited on each node.

      When creating a new application with application capacity defined, the
      product of MaximumNodes

      and this value must always be smaller than or equal to
      TotalApplicationCapacity.

      When updating existing application with application capacity, the product
      of MaximumNodes and

      this value must always be smaller than or equal to
      TotalApplicationCapacity.

      The node reservation capacity for Service Fabric application.

      This is the amount of load which is reserved on nodes which have instances
      of this

      application.

      If MinimumNodes is specified, then the product of these values will be the
      capacity reserved

      in the cluster for the application.

      If set to zero, no capacity is reserved for this metric.

      When setting application capacity or when updating application capacity;
      this value must be

      smaller than or equal to MaximumCapacity for each metric.

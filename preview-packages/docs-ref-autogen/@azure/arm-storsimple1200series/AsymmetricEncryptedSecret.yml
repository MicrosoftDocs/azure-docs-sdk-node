summary: >-
  This class can be used as the Type for any secret entity represented as
  Password, CertThumbprint, Algorithm. This class is intended to be used when
  the secret is encrypted with an asymmetric key pair. The encryptionAlgorithm
  field is mainly for future usage to potentially allow different entities
  encrypted using different algorithms.

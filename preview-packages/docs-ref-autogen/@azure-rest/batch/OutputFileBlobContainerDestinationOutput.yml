    package: '@azure-rest/batch'
    summary: >-
      The destination blob or virtual directory within the Azure Storage
      container. If filePattern refers to a specific file (i.e. contains no
      wildcards), then path is the name of the blob to which to upload that
      file. If filePattern contains one or more wildcards (and therefore may
      match multiple files), then path is the name of the blob virtual directory
      (which is prepended to each blob name) to which to upload the file(s). If
      omitted, file(s) are uploaded to the root of the container with a blob
      name matching their file name.

      files. These headers will be specified when uploading files to Azure
      Storage. Official document on allowed headers when uploading blobs:

summary: >-
  Constrains effort on reasoning for

  [reasoning models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning).

  Currently supported values are `none`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, and
  `xhigh`. Reducing

  reasoning effort can result in faster responses and fewer tokens used

  on reasoning in a response.

  - `gpt-5.1` defaults to `none`, which does not perform reasoning. The
  supported reasoning values for `gpt-5.1` are `none`, `low`, `medium`, and
  `high`. Tool calls are supported for all reasoning values in gpt-5.1.

  - All models before `gpt-5.1` default to `medium` reasoning effort, and do not
  support `none`.

  - The `gpt-5-pro` model defaults to (and only supports) `high` reasoning
  effort.

  - `xhigh` is supported for all models after `gpt-5.1-codex-max`.

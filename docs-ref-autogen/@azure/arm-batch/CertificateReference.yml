      The default value is currentUser. This property is applicable only for
      pools configured with Windows nodes (that is, created with
      cloudServiceConfiguration, or with virtualMachineConfiguration using a
      Windows image reference). For Linux compute nodes, the certificates are
      stored in a directory inside the task working directory and an environment
      variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to query for
      this location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs'
      directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g.,
      /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed in that directory.

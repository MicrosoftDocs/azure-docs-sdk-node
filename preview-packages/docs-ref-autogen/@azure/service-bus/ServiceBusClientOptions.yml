  Describes the options that can be provided while creating the
  ServiceBusClient.


  - `webSocketOptions` : Options to configure the channelling of the AMQP
  connection over Web Sockets.
     - `websocket`     : The WebSocket constructor used to create an AMQP connection if you choose to make the connection
  over a WebSocket.
     - `webSocketConstructorOptions` : Options to pass to the Websocket constructor when you choose to make the connection
  over a WebSocket.

  - `retryOptions`     : The retry options for all the operations on the client.
     - `maxRetries` : The number of times the operation can be retried in case of a retryable error.
     - `maxRetryDelayInMs`: The maximum delay between retries. Applicable only when performing exponential retries.
     - `mode`: Which retry mode to apply, specified by the `RetryMode` enum. Options are `Exponential` and `Fixed`. Defaults to `Fixed`.
     - `retryDelayInMs`: Amount of time to wait in milliseconds before making the next attempt. When `mode` is set to `Exponential`,
        this is used to compute the exponentially increasing delays between retries. Default: 30000 milliseconds.
     - `timeoutInMs`: Amount of time in milliseconds to wait before the operation times out. This will trigger a retry if there are any
        retry attempts remaining. Minimum value: 60000 milliseconds.

      A custom endpoint to use when connecting to the Service Bus service.
      This can be useful when your network does not allow connecting to the
      standard Azure Service Bus endpoint address, but does allow connecting
      through an intermediary.

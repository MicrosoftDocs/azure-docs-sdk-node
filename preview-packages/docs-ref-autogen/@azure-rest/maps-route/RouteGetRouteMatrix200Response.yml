  If the Matrix Route request was accepted successfully, the Location header in
  the response contains the URL to download the results of the request. This
  status URI looks like the following:

    ```
      GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/{matrixId}?api-version=1.0?subscription-key={subscription-key}
    ```


  4. Client issues a GET request on the download URL obtained in Step 3 to
  download the results


  ### Download Sync Results

  When you make a POST request for Route Matrix Sync API, the service returns
  200 response code for successful request and a response array. The response
  body will contain the data and there will be no possibility to retrieve the
  results later.


  ### Download Async Results

  When a request issues a `202 Accepted` response, the request is being
  processed using our async pipeline. You will be given a URL to check the
  progress of your  async request in the location header of the response. This
  status URI looks like the following:

  ```
    GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/{matrixId}?api-version=1.0?subscription-key={subscription-key}
  ```


  The URL provided by the location header will return the following responses
  when a `GET` request is issued.

    > HTTP `202 Accepted` - Matrix request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some time.

    > HTTP `200 OK` - Matrix request successfully processed. The response body contains all of the results.

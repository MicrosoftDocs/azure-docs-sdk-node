      The exit code of the program specified on the task command line. This
      property is set only if

      the task is in the completed state. In general, the exit code for a
      process reflects the

      specific convention implemented by the application developer for that
      process. If you use the

      exit code value to make decisions in your code, be sure that you know the
      exit code convention

      used by the application process. However, if the Batch service terminates
      the task (due to

      timeout, or user termination via the API) you may see an operating
      system-defined exit code.

      this is typically the

      same as startTime, but may be different if the task has been restarted for
      reasons other than

      retry; for example, if the compute node was rebooted during a retry, then
      the startTime is

      updated but the lastRetryTime is not.

      the pool) or when the

      nodes be requeued for

      execution. This count tracks how many times the task has been requeued for

      time reflects the

      time at which the task started downloading or deploying these. If the task
      has been restarted

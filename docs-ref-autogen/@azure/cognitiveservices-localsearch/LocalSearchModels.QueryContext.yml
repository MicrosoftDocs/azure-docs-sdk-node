      if the query has adult intent; otherwise, false.

      The query string to use to force Bing to use the original string. For
      example, if the query

      string is "saling downwind", the override query string will be "+saling
      downwind". Remember to

      encode the query string which results in "%2Bsaling+downwind". This field
      is included only if

      the original query string contains a spelling mistake.

      The query string used by Bing to perform the query. Bing uses the altered
      query string if the

      original query string contained spelling mistakes. For example, if the
      query string is "saling

      downwind", the altered query string will be "sailing downwind". This field
      is included only if

      the original query string contains a spelling mistake.

    package: '@azure/cognitiveservices-localsearch'
    summary: >-
      A Boolean value that indicates whether Bing requires the user's location
      to provide accurate

      results. If you specified the user's location by using the
      X-MSEdge-ClientIP and

      X-Search-Location headers, you can ignore this field. For location aware
      queries, such as

      "today's weather" or "restaurants near me" that need the user's location
      to provide accurate

      results, this field is set to true. For location aware queries that
      include the location (for

      example, "Seattle weather"), this field is set to false. This field is
      also set to false for

      queries that are not location aware, such as "best sellers".

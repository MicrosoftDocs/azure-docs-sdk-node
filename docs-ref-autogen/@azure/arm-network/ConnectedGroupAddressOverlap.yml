  ### Known values supported by the service

  **Allowed**: Default. Allows connected group members to have overlapping IP
  address space. \

  **Disallowed**: Strictly disallows connected group members from having
  overlapping IP address space. Prevents the addition of a virtual network with
  overlapping address to the connected group, blocks peering between a virtual
  network and a connected group member if any connected group member has an
  overlapping range, and restricts address space modifications that would
  introduce overlap.

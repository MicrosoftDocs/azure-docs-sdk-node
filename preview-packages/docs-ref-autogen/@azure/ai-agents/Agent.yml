    summary: >-
      An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling,
      where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability
      mass.

      So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are
      considered.


      We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

summary: >-
  Send this event to truncate a previous assistant message’s audio. The server

  will produce audio faster than voicelive, so this event is useful when the
  user

  interrupts to truncate audio that has already been sent to the client but not

  yet played. This will synchronize the server's understanding of the audio with

  the client's playback.

  Truncating audio will delete the server-side text transcript to ensure there

  is not text in the context that hasn't been heard by the user.

  If successful, the server will respond with a `conversation.item.truncated`

  event.

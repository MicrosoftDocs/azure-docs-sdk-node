summary: >-
  Returned when an earlier assistant audio message item is truncated by the

  client with a `conversation.item.truncate` event. This event is used to

  synchronize the server's understanding of the audio with the client's
  playback.

  This action will truncate the audio and remove the server-side text transcript

  to ensure there is no text in the context that hasn't been heard by the user.

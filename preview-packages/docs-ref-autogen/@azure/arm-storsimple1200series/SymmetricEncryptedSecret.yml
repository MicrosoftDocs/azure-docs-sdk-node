  This class can be used as the Type for any secret entity represented as Value,
  ValueCertificateThumbprint, EncryptionAlgorithm. In this case, "Value" is a
  secret and the "valueThumbprint" represents the certificate thumbprint of the
  value. The algorithm field is mainly for future usage to potentially allow
  different entities encrypted using different algorithms.

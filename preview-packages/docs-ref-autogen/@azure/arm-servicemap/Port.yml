  A port resource represents a server port on a machine. The port may be
  actively *monitored*, i.e., a Dependency Agent is running on its machine, or
  *discovered*, i.e., its existence was inferred by observing the data stream
  from monitored machines. A port is live during an interval of time, if that
  port had associated activity during (parts) of that interval.

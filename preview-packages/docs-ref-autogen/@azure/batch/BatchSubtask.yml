      The exit code of the program specified on the subtask command line. This
      property is set only if the subtask is in the completed state. In general,
      the exit code for a process reflects the specific convention implemented
      by the application developer for that process. If you use the exit code
      value to make decisions in your code, be sure that you know the exit code
      convention used by the application process. However, if the Batch service
      terminates the subtask (due to timeout, or user termination via the API)
      you may see an operating system-defined exit code.

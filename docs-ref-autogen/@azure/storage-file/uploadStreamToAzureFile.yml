      ONLY AVAILABLE IN NODE.JS RUNTIME.

      Uploads a Node.js Readable stream into an Azure file.

      This method will try to create an Azure, then starts uploading chunk by
      chunk.

      Size of chunk is defined by `bufferSize` parameter.

      Please make sure potential size of stream doesn't exceed file size.


      PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT TIPS:

      * Input stream highWaterMark is better to set a same value with bufferSize
        parameter, which will avoid Buffer.concat() operations.

      Gets or sets Name of the API.

      The name of the operation being performed on this particular object. It
      should

      match the action name that appears in RBAC / the event service.

      Examples of operations include:

      * Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachine/capture/action

      * Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachine/restart/action

      * Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachine/write

      * Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachine/read

      * Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachine/delete

      Each action should include, in order:

      (1) Resource Provider Namespace

      (2) Type hierarchy for which the action applies (e.g. server/databases for
      a SQL

      Azure database)

      (3) Read, Write, Action or Delete indicating which type applies. If it is
      a PUT/PATCH

      on a collection or named value, Write should be used.

      If it is a GET, Read should be used. If it is a DELETE, Delete should be
      used. If it

      is a POST, Action should be used.

      As a note: all resource providers would need to include the "{Resource
      Provider

      Namespace}/register/action" operation in their response.

      This API is used to register for their service, and should include details
      about the

      operation (e.g. a localized name for the resource provider + any special

      considerations like PII release).

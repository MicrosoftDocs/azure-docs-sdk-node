    summary: >-
      Distance from the coordinate to the closest border of the geofence.
      Positive means the coordinate is outside of the geofence. If the
      coordinate is outside of the geofence, but more than the value of
      searchBuffer away from the closest geofence border, then the value is 999.
      Negative means the coordinate is inside of the geofence. If the coordinate
      is inside the polygon, but more than the value of searchBuffer away from
      the closest geofencing border,then the value is -999. A value of 999 means
      that there is great confidence the coordinate is well outside the
      geofence. A value of -999 means that there is great confidence the
      coordinate is well within the geofence.

      PropertySelector is a property query over all joined member clusters.
      Clusters matching the query are selected. If you specify both label and

      moment, PropertySelector can only be used with
      `RequiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` affinity terms. This
      field is beta-level; it is for the property-based scheduling feature and
      is only functional when a property provider is enabled in the deployment.

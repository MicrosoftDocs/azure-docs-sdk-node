      A description of an encryption key that you create in Azure Key Vault.
      This key is used to provide an additional level of encryption-at-rest for
      your knowledge base definition when you want full assurance that no one,
      not even Microsoft, can decrypt them. Once you have encrypted your
      knowledge base definition, it will always remain encrypted. The search
      service will ignore attempts to set this property to null. You can change
      this property as needed if you want to rotate your encryption key; Your
      knowledge base definition will be unaffected. Encryption with
      customer-managed keys is not available for free search services, and is
      only available for paid services created on or after January 1, 2019.

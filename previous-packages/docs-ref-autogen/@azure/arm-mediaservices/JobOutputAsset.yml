    summary: >-
      A label that is assigned to a JobOutput in order to help uniquely identify
      it. This is useful when your Transform has more than one TransformOutput,
      whereby your Job has more than one JobOutput. In such cases, when you
      submit the Job, you will add two or more JobOutputs, in the same order as
      TransformOutputs in the Transform. Subsequently, when you retrieve the
      Job, either through events or on a GET request, you can use the label to
      easily identify the JobOutput. If a label is not provided, a default value
      of '{presetName}_{outputIndex}' will be used, where the preset name is the
      name of the preset in the corresponding TransformOutput and the output
      index is the relative index of the this JobOutput within the Job. Note
      that this index is the same as the relative index of the corresponding
      TransformOutput within its Transform.

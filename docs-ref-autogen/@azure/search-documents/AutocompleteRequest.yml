      autocomplete query in order for the query to be reported as a success.
      This parameter can be

      replica. The default

      is 80.

    package: '@azure/search-documents'
    summary: >-
      A value indicating whether to use fuzzy matching for the autocomplete
      query. Default is false.

      When set to true, the query will autocomplete terms even if there's a
      substituted or missing

      character in the search text. While this provides a better experience in
      some scenarios, it

      comes at a performance cost as fuzzy autocomplete queries are slower and
      consume more

      resources.

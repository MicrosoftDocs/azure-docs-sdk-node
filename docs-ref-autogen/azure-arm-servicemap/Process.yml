      A process resource represents a process running on a machine. The process

      may be actively *monitored*, i.e., a Dependency Agent is running on its

      machine, or *discovered*, i.e., its existence was inferred by observing
      the

      data stream from monitored machines. A process resource represents a pool
      of

      actual operating system resources that share command lines and metadata.
      As

      the process pool evolves over time, prior versions of the process resource

      are preserved and available for access. A process is live during an
      interval

      of time, if that process is executing during (parts) of that interval

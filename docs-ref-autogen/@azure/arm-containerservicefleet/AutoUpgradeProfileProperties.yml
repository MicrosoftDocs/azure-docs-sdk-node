      If set to False: the auto upgrade has effect - target managed clusters
      will be upgraded on schedule.

      If set to True: the auto upgrade has no effect - no upgrade will be run on
      the target managed clusters.

      This is a boolean and not an enum because enabled/disabled are all
      available states of the auto upgrade profile.

      By default, this is set to False.

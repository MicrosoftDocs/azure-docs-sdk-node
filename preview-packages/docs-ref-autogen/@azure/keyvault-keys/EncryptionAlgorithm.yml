  JsonWebKeyEncryptionAlgorithm,
   this enum contains the known values that the service supports.
  ### Known values supported by the service

  **RSA-OAEP**: [Not recommended] RSAES using Optimal Asymmetric Encryption
  Padding (OAEP), as described in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447, with the
  default parameters specified by RFC 3447 in Section A.2.1. Those default
  parameters are using a hash function of SHA-1 and a mask generation function
  of MGF1 with SHA-1. Microsoft recommends using RSA_OAEP_256 or stronger
  algorithms for enhanced security. Microsoft does *not* recommend RSA_OAEP,
  which is included solely for backwards compatibility. RSA_OAEP utilizes SHA1,
  which has known collision problems. \

  **RSA-OAEP-256**: RSAES using Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding with a
  hash function of SHA-256 and a mask generation function of MGF1 with SHA-256.
  \

  **RSA1_5**: [Not recommended] RSAES-PKCS1-V1_5 key encryption, as described in
  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447. Microsoft recommends using RSA_OAEP_256
  or stronger algorithms for enhanced security. Microsoft does *not* recommend
  RSA_1_5, which is included solely for backwards compatibility. Cryptographic
  standards no longer consider RSA with the PKCS#1 v1.5 padding scheme secure
  for encryption. \

  **A128GCM**: 128-bit AES-GCM. \

  **A192GCM**: 192-bit AES-GCM. \

  **A256GCM**: 256-bit AES-GCM. \

  **A128KW**: 128-bit AES key wrap. \

  **A192KW**: 192-bit AES key wrap. \

  **A256KW**: 256-bit AES key wrap. \

  **A128CBC**: 128-bit AES-CBC. \

  **A192CBC**: 192-bit AES-CBC. \

  **A256CBC**: 256-bit AES-CBC. \

  **A128CBCPAD**: 128-bit AES-CBC with PKCS padding. \

  **A192CBCPAD**: 192-bit AES-CBC with PKCS padding. \

  **A256CBCPAD**: 256-bit AES-CBC with PKCS padding. \

  **CKM_AES_KEY_WRAP**: CKM AES key wrap. \

  **CKM_AES_KEY_WRAP_PAD**: CKM AES key wrap with padding.

  Defines values for KillChainIntent. \

  <xref:@azure/arm-securityinsight.KnownKillChainIntent> can be used
  interchangeably with KillChainIntent,
   this enum contains the known values that the service supports.
  ### Known values supported by the service

  **Unknown**: The default value. \

  **Probing**: Probing could be an attempt to access a certain resource
  regardless of a malicious intent or a failed attempt to gain access to a
  target system to gather information prior to exploitation. This step is
  usually detected as an attempt originating from outside the network in attempt
  to scan the target system and find a way in. \

  **Exploitation**: Exploitation is the stage where an attacker manage to get
  foothold on the attacked resource. This stage is applicable not only for
  compute hosts, but also for resources such as user accounts, certificates etc.
  Adversaries will often be able to control the resource after this stage. \

  **Persistence**: Persistence is any access, action, or configuration change to
  a system that gives an adversary a persistent presence on that system.
  Adversaries will often need to maintain access to systems through
  interruptions such as system restarts, loss of credentials, or other failures
  that would require a remote access tool to restart or alternate backdoor for
  them to regain access. \

  **PrivilegeEscalation**: Privilege escalation is the result of actions that
  allow an adversary to obtain a higher level of permissions on a system or
  network. Certain tools or actions require a higher level of privilege to work
  and are likely necessary at many points throughout an operation. User accounts
  with permissions to access specific systems or perform specific functions
  necessary for adversaries to achieve their objective may also be considered an
  escalation of privilege. \

  **DefenseEvasion**: Defense evasion consists of techniques an adversary may
  use to evade detection or avoid other defenses. Sometimes these actions are
  the same as or variations of techniques in other categories that have the
  added benefit of subverting a particular defense or mitigation.  \

  **CredentialAccess**: Credential access represents techniques resulting in
  access to or control over system, domain, or service credentials that are used
  within an enterprise environment. Adversaries will likely attempt to obtain
  legitimate credentials from users or administrator accounts (local system
  administrator or domain users with administrator access) to use within the
  network. With sufficient access within a network, an adversary can create
  accounts for later use within the environment. \

  **Discovery**: Discovery consists of techniques that allow the adversary to
  gain knowledge about the system and internal network. When adversaries gain
  access to a new system, they must orient themselves to what they now have
  control of and what benefits operating from that system give to their current
  objective or overall goals during the intrusion. The operating system provides
  many native tools that aid in this post-compromise information-gathering
  phase. \

  **LateralMovement**: Lateral movement consists of techniques that enable an
  adversary to access and control remote systems on a network and could, but
  does not necessarily, include execution of tools on remote systems. The
  lateral movement techniques could allow an adversary to gather information
  from a system without needing additional tools, such as a remote access tool.
  An adversary can use lateral movement for many purposes, including remote
  Execution of tools, pivoting to additional systems, access to specific
  information or files, access to additional credentials, or to cause an effect.
  \

  **Execution**: The execution tactic represents techniques that result in
  execution of adversary-controlled code on a local or remote system. This
  tactic is often used in conjunction with lateral movement to expand access to
  remote systems on a network. \

  **Collection**: Collection consists of techniques used to identify and gather
  information, such as sensitive files, from a target network prior to
  exfiltration. This category also covers locations on a system or network where
  the adversary may look for information to exfiltrate. \

  **Exfiltration**: Exfiltration refers to techniques and attributes that result
  or aid in the adversary removing files and information from a target network.
  This category also covers locations on a system or network where the adversary
  may look for information to exfiltrate. \

  **CommandAndControl**: The command and control tactic represents how
  adversaries communicate with systems under their control within a target
  network. \

  **Impact**: The impact intent primary objective is to directly reduce the
  availability or integrity of a system, service, or network; including
  manipulation of data to impact a business or operational process. This would
  often refer to techniques such as ransom-ware, defacement, data manipulation
  and others.

    summary: >-
      Creates an instance of the EnvironmentCredential class and decides what
      credential to use depending on the available environment variables.


      Required environment variables:

      - `AZURE_TENANT_ID`: The Azure Active Directory tenant (directory) ID.

      - `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`: The client (application) ID of an App Registration in
      the tenant.


      If setting the AZURE_TENANT_ID, then you can also set the additionally
      allowed tenants

      - `AZURE_ADDITIONALLY_ALLOWED_TENANTS`: For multi-tenant applications,
      specifies additional tenants for which the credential may acquire tokens
      with a single semicolon delimited string. Use * to allow all tenants.


      Environment variables used for client credential authentication:

      - `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`: A client secret that was generated for the App
      Registration.

      - `AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PATH`: The path to a PEM certificate to use
      during the authentication, instead of the client secret.

      - `AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`: (optional) password for the
      certificate file.


      Alternatively, users can provide environment variables for username and
      password authentication:

      - `AZURE_USERNAME`: Username to authenticate with.

      - `AZURE_PASSWORD`: Password to authenticate with.


      If the environment variables required to perform the authentication are
      missing, a
      [CredentialUnavailableError](xref:@azure/identity.CredentialUnavailableError)
      will be thrown.

      If the authentication fails, or if there's an unknown error, an
      [AuthenticationError](xref:@azure/identity.AuthenticationError) will be
      thrown.

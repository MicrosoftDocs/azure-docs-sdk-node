      Maximum length is 128 characters. For [partitioned

      setting this value enables assigning related messages to the same internal
      partition,

      so that submission sequence order is correctly recorded. The partition is
      chosen by a hash

      function over this value and cannot be chosen directly.

      - For session-aware entities, the `sessionId` property overrides this
      value.

      - For non partitioned entities, partition key will be ignored

      The address of an entity to send replies to. This optional and

      application-defined value is a standard way to express a reply path to the

      The date and time in UTC at which the message will

      property, the

      supplied DateTime value must also be in UTC. This value is for delayed
      message sending.

      It is utilized to delay messages sending to a specific time in the future.
      Message enqueuing

      time does not mean that the message will be sent at the same time. It will
      get enqueued,

      but the actual sending time depends on the queue's workload and its state.

      the session affiliation of the message. Messages with the same session
      identifier are subject

      to summary locking and enable exact in-order processing and
      demultiplexing. For

      session-unaware entities, this value is ignored.

      `timeToLive` value cannot be longer than the entity's DefaultTimeToLive

  [KnownNodeOSUpgradeChannel](xref:@azure/arm-containerservice.KnownNodeOSUpgradeChannel)
  can be used interchangeably with NodeOSUpgradeChannel,
   this enum contains the known values that the service supports.
  ### Known values supported by the service

  **None**: No attempt to update your machines OS will be made either by OS or
  by rolling VHDs. This means you are responsible for your security updates \

  **Unmanaged**: OS updates will be applied automatically through the OS
  built-in patching infrastructure. Newly scaled in machines will be unpatched
  initially and will be patched at some point by the OS's infrastructure.
  Behavior of this option depends on the OS in question. Ubuntu and Mariner
  apply security patches through unattended upgrade roughly once a day around
  06:00 UTC. Windows does not apply security patches automatically and so for
  them this option is equivalent to None till further notice \

  **NodeImage**: AKS will update the nodes with a newly patched VHD containing
  security fixes and bugfixes on a weekly cadence. With the VHD update machines
  will be rolling reimaged to that VHD following maintenance windows and surge
  settings. No extra VHD cost is incurred when choosing this option as AKS hosts
  the images. \

  **SecurityPatch**: AKS downloads and updates the nodes with tested security
  updates. These updates honor the maintenance window settings and produce a new
  VHD that is used on new nodes. On some occasions it's not possible to apply
  the updates in place, in such cases the existing nodes will also be re-imaged
  to the newly produced VHD in order to apply the changes. This option incurs an
  extra cost of hosting the new Security Patch VHDs in your resource group for
  just in time consumption.

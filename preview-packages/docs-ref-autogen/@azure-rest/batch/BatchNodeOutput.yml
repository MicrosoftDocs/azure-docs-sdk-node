      For Windows Nodes, the Batch service installs the Certificates to the
      specified Certificate store and location.

      For Linux Compute Nodes, the Certificates are stored in a directory inside
      the Task working directory and an environment variable
      AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the Task to query for this
      location.

      For Certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs' directory is
      created in the user's home directory (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and
      Certificates are placed in that directory.

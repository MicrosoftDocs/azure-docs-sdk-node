  List of network mappings. As with NetworkMapping, it should be possible to
  reuse a prev version of this class. It doesn't seem likely this class could be
  anything more than a slightly bespoke collection of NetworkMapping. Hence it
  makes sense to override Load with Base.NetworkMapping instead of existing
  CurrentVersion.NetworkMapping.

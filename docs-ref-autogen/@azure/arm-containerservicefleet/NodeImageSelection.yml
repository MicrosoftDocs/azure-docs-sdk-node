      Custom node image versions to upgrade the nodes to. This field is required
      if node image selection type is Custom. Otherwise, it must be empty. For
      each node image family (e.g., 'AKSUbuntu-1804gen2containerd'), this field
      can contain at most one version (e.g., only one of
      'AKSUbuntu-1804gen2containerd-2023.01.12' or
      'AKSUbuntu-1804gen2containerd-2023.02.12', not both). If the nodes belong
      to a family without a matching image version in this field, they are not
      upgraded.

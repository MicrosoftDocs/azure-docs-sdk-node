# JavaScript resource management modules for Azure Search

Azure Search is a search-as-a-service cloud solution that gives developers APIs and tools for adding a rich search experience over private, heterogeneous content in web, mobile, and enterprise applications. This JavaScript module provides resource management APIs for creating and updating a search service, managing access keys, and allocating replicas and partitionss. You cannot change tiers (SKU) or location with these APIs.

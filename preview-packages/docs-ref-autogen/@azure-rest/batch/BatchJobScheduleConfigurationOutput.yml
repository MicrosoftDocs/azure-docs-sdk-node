      A time after which no Job will be created under this Job Schedule. The
      schedule will move to the completed state as soon as this deadline is past
      and there is no active Job under this Job Schedule. If you do not specify
      a doNotRunAfter time, and you are creating a recurring Job Schedule, the
      Job Schedule will remain active until you explicitly terminate it.

  - name: recurrenceInterval

    package: '@azure-rest/batch'
    summary: >-
      The time interval between the start times of two successive Jobs under the
      Job Schedule. A Job Schedule can have at most one active Job under it at
      any given time. Because a Job Schedule can have at most one active Job
      under it at any given time, if it is time to create a new Job under a Job
      Schedule, but the previous Job is still running, the Batch service will
      not create the new Job until the previous Job finishes. If the previous
      Job does not finish within the startWindow period of the new
      recurrenceInterval, then no new Job will be scheduled for that interval.
      For recurring Jobs, you should normally specify a jobManagerTask in the
      jobSpecification. If you do not use jobManagerTask, you will need an
      external process to monitor when Jobs are created, add Tasks to the Jobs
      and terminate the Jobs ready for the next recurrence. The default is that
      the schedule does not recur: one Job is created, within the startWindow
      after the doNotRunUntil time, and the schedule is complete as soon as that
      Job finishes. The minimum value is 1 minute. If you specify a lower value,
      the Batch service rejects the schedule with an error; if you are calling
      the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request).

    package: '@azure-rest/batch'
    summary: >-
      The time interval, starting from the time at which the schedule indicates
      a Job should be created, within which a Job must be created. If a Job is
      not created within the startWindow interval, then the 'opportunity' is
      lost; no Job will be created until the next recurrence of the schedule. If
      the schedule is recurring, and the startWindow is longer than the
      recurrence interval, then this is equivalent to an infinite startWindow,
      because the Job that is 'due' in one recurrenceInterval is not carried
      forward into the next recurrence interval. The default is infinite. The
      minimum value is 1 minute. If you specify a lower value, the Batch service
      rejects the schedule with an error; if you are calling the REST API
      directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request).

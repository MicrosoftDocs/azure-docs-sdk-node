      The configuration for data disks attached to the Compute Nodes in the
      Pool. This property must

      be specified if the Compute Nodes in the Pool need to have empty data
      disks attached to them.

      This cannot be updated. Each Compute Node gets its own disk (the disk is
      not a file share).

      Existing disks cannot be attached, each attached disk is empty. When the
      Compute Node is

      removed from the Pool, the disk and all data associated with it is also
      deleted. The disk is

      not formatted after being attached, it must be formatted before use - for

      The SKU of the Batch Compute Node agent to be provisioned on Compute Nodes
      in the Pool. The

      Batch Compute Node agent is a program that runs on each Compute Node in
      the Pool, and provides

      the command-and-control interface between the Compute Node and the Batch
      service. There are

      different implementations of the Compute Node agent, known as SKUs, for
      different operating

      systems. You must specify a Compute Node agent SKU which matches the
      selected Image reference.

      To get the list of supported Compute Node agent SKUs along with their list
      of verified Image

      references, see the 'List supported Compute Node agent SKUs' operation.

      This property sets the connection region for Playwright client workers to
      cloud-hosted browsers. If enabled, workers connect to browsers in the
      closest Azure region, ensuring lower latency. If disabled, workers connect
      to browsers in the Azure region in which the workspace was initially
      created.

      significantly minimizing test completion durations.

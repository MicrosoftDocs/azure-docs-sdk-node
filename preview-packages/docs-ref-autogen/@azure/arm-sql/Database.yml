      This property is only supported for DataWarehouse edition and allows to
      restore across subscriptions.


      When sourceResourceId is specified, sourceDatabaseId,
      recoverableDatabaseId, restorableDroppedDatabaseId and
      sourceDatabaseDeletionDate must not be specified and CreateMode must be
      PointInTimeRestore, Restore or Recover.


      When createMode is PointInTimeRestore, sourceResourceId must be the
      resource ID of the existing database or existing sql pool, and
      restorePointInTime must be specified.


      When createMode is Restore, sourceResourceId must be the resource ID of
      restorable dropped database or restorable dropped sql pool.


      When createMode is Recover, sourceResourceId must be the resource ID of
      recoverable database or recoverable sql pool.


      When source subscription belongs to a different tenant than target
      subscription, “x-ms-authorization-auxiliary” header must contain

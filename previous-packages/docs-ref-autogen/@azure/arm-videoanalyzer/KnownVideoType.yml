      Archive is flexible format that represents a video stream associated with
      wall-clock time. The video archive can either be continuous or
      discontinuous. An archive is discontinuous when there are gaps in the
      recording due to various reasons, such as the live pipeline being stopped,
      camera being disconnected or due to the use of event based recordings
      through the use of a signal gate. There is no limit to the archive
      duration and new video data can be appended to the existing archive at any
      time, as long as the same video codec and codec parameters are being used.
      Videos of this type are suitable for appending and long term archival.

      consumption.

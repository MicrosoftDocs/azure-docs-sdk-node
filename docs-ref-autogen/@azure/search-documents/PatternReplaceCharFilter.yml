summary: >-
  A character filter that replaces characters in the input string. It uses a
  regular expression to identify character sequences to preserve and a
  replacement pattern to identify characters to replace. For example, given the
  input text "aa bb aa bb", pattern "(aa)\s+(bb)", and replacement "$1#$2", the
  result would be "aa#bb aa#bb". This character filter is implemented using
  Apache Lucene.

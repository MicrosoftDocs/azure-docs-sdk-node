package: '@azure/event-hubs'
summary: >+
  An interface representing a batch of events which can be used to send events
  to Event Hub.

  To create the batch, use the `createBatch()` method on the
  `EventHubProducerClient`.

  To send the batch, use the `sendBatch()` method on the same client.

  To fill the batch, use the `tryAdd()` method on the batch itself.

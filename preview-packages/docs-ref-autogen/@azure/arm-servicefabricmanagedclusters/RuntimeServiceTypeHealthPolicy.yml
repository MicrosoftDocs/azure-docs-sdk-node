      The maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy partitions per service.


      The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of partitions
      that can be unhealthy before the service is considered in error.

      If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy
      partition, the health is evaluated as Warning.

      The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy
      partitions over the total number of partitions in the service.

      The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of
      partitions.

      The maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy replicas per partition.


      The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of replicas
      that can be unhealthy before the partition is considered in error.

      If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy
      replica, the health is evaluated as Warning.

      The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy replicas
      over the total number of replicas in the partition.

      replicas.

      The maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy services.


      The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of services
      that can be unhealthy before the application is considered in error.

      If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy
      service, the health is evaluated as Warning.

      This is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy services of the
      specific service type over the total number of services of the specific
      service type.

      The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of
      services.

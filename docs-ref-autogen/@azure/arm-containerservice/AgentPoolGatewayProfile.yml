    summary: >-
      The Gateway agent pool associates one public IPPrefix for each static
      egress gateway to provide public egress. The size of Public IPPrefix
      should be selected by the user. Each node in the agent pool is assigned
      with one IP from the IPPrefix. The IPPrefix size thus serves as a cap on
      the size of the Gateway agent pool. Due to Azure public IPPrefix size
      limitation, the valid value range is [28, 31] (/31 = 2 nodes/IPs, /30 = 4
      nodes/IPs, /29 = 8 nodes/IPs, /28 = 16 nodes/IPs). The default value is
      31.

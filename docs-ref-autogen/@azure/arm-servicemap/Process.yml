  A process resource represents a process running on a machine. The process may
  be actively

  *monitored*, i.e., a Dependency Agent is running on its machine, or
  *discovered*, i.e., its

  existence was inferred by observing the data stream from monitored machines. A
  process resource

  represents a pool of actual operating system resources that share command
  lines and metadata. As

  the process pool evolves over time, prior versions of the process resource are
  preserved and

  available for access. A process is live during an interval of time, if that
  process is executing

  during (parts) of that interval

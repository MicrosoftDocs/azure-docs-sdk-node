# Azure Storage Library for JavaScript

[Azure Storage](/azure/storage) is a Microsoft managed service providing cloud storage that is highly available, secure, durable, scalable, and redundant. The following libraries in JavaScript make it easy to consume Azure Storage service.

## Client Packages (12.X.X)

## Known issues

This section details known issues for the Azure Storage client libraries for JavaScript.

### InvalidHeaderValue error message when using beta version of SDK

In rare scenarios, applications that have upgraded to the latest beta or generally available version of the SDK can receive an `InvalidHeaderValue` error message. This issue can occur when using any of the Storage libraries. The error message looks similar to the following sample:

```console
HTTP/1.1 400 The value for one of the HTTP headers is not in the correct format.
Content-Length: 328
Content-Type: application/xml
Server: Microsoft-HTTPAPI/2.0
x-ms-request-id: <REMOVED>
Date: Fri, 19 May 2023 17:10:33 GMT
 
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><Error><Code>InvalidHeaderValue</Code><Message>The value for one of the HTTP headers is not in the correct format.
RequestId:<REMOVED>
Time:2023-05-19T17:10:34.2972651Z</Message><HeaderName>x-ms-version</HeaderName><HeaderValue>yyyy-mm-dd</HeaderValue></Error> 
```

If you've upgraded to the latest beta or generally available version of the SDK and you experience this error, it's recommended that you downgrade to the previous generally available version of the SDK to see if the issue resolves. If the issue persists, or if the recommendation is not feasible, [open a support ticket](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Support) to explore further options.

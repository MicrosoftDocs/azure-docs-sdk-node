      This option discards the original full-precision vectors. Choose this
      option for maximum storage savings. Since this option does not allow for
      rescoring and oversampling, it will often cause slight to moderate
      reductions in quality.

    summary: >-
      This option preserves the original full-precision vectors. Choose this
      option for maximum flexibility and highest quality of compressed search
      results. This consumes more storage but allows for rescoring and
      oversampling.

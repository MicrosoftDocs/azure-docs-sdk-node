      into consideration the Update Domain and maxBatchInstancePercent to
      determine the batch size.

    summary: >-
      The maximum percent of total virtual machine instances that will be
      upgraded simultaneously by the rolling upgrade in one batch. As this is a
      maximum, unhealthy instances in previous or future batches can cause the
      percentage of instances in a batch to decrease to ensure higher
      reliability. The default value for this parameter is 20%.

    summary: >-
      The maximum percentage of the total virtual machine instances in the scale
      set that can be simultaneously unhealthy, either as a result of being
      upgraded, or by being found in an unhealthy state by the virtual machine
      health checks before the rolling upgrade aborts. This constraint will be
      checked prior to starting any batch. The default value for this parameter
      is 20%.

      The maximum percentage of upgraded virtual machine instances that can be
      found to be in an unhealthy state. This check will happen after each batch
      is upgraded. If this percentage is ever exceeded, the rolling update
      aborts. The default value for this parameter is 20%.

      The wait time between completing the update for all virtual machines in

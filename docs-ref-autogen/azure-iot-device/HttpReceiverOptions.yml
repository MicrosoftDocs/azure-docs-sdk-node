summary: >-
  Options structure used to configure how often the HTTP receiver polls for
  messages.

  Each of these options is mutually exclusive, except for the `drain` boolean.
  Only one `interval`, `at`, `cron` or `manualPolling` shall be present in the
  options structure.


  This is configured by calling
  [setOptions](xref:azure-iot-device.Client.setOptions_1) with this as a
  property named `receivePolicy` inside of an
  [HttpTransportOptions](xref:azure-iot-device.HttpTransportOptions) object
  which is inside of an
  [DeviceClientOptions](xref:azure-iot-device.DeviceClientOptions) object.

      Whether to withdraw Compute Nodes from the virtual network to DNC when the
      job is terminated or deleted.  If true, nodes will remain joined to the
      virtual network to DNC. If false, nodes will automatically withdraw when
      the job ends. Defaults to false.

    summary: >-
      The ARM resource identifier of the virtual network subnet which Compute
      Nodes running Tasks from the Job will join for the duration of the Task.
      The virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as the
      Azure Batch Account. The specified subnet should have enough free IP
      addresses to accommodate the number of Compute Nodes which will run Tasks
      from the Job. This can be up to the number of Compute Nodes in the Pool.
      The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service principal must have the 'Classic Virtual
      Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) role for the
      specified VNet so that Azure Batch service can schedule Tasks on the
      Nodes. This can be verified by checking if the specified VNet has any
      associated Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication to the Nodes in
      the specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch service will set
      the state of the Compute Nodes to unusable. This is of the form
      /subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/{group}/providers/{provider}/virtualNetworks/{network}/subnets/{subnet}.
      If the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG),
      then a few reserved system ports must be enabled for inbound communication
      from the Azure Batch service. For Pools created with a Virtual Machine
      configuration, enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well as port 22 for Linux
      and port 3389 for Windows. Port 443 is also required to be open for
      outbound connections for communications to Azure Storage. For more details

      Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries. The
      Batch

      service will try each Task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For
      example, if the

      maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries a Task up to 4 times (one initial
      try and 3 retries). If

      the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry Tasks. If
      the maximum retry

      count is -1, the Batch service retries Tasks without limit. The default
      value is 0 (no

      retries).

      If the Job does not complete within the time limit, the Batch service
      terminates

      it and any Tasks that are still running. In this case, the termination
      reason will be

      MaxWallClockTimeExpiry. If this property is not specified, there is no
      time limit on how long

      the Job may run.

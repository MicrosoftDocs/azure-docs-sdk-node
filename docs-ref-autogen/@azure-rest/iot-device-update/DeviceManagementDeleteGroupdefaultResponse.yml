summary: >-
  Deletes a device group. This group is automatically created when a Device
  Update-enabled device is connected to the hub and reports its properties.
  Groups, subgroups, and deployments are not automatically cleaned up but are
  retained for history purposes. Users can call this method to delete a group if
  they do not need to retain any of the history of the group and no longer need
  it. If a device is ever connected again for this group after the group was
  deleted it will be automatically re-created but there will be no history.

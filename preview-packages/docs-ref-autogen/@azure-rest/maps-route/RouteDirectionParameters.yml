      This is a list of 3-character, ISO 3166-1, alpha-3 country codes of
      countries in which toll roads with vignettes are allowed, e.g. "AUS,CHE".
      Specifying **allowVignette** with some countries X is equivalent to
      specifying **avoidVignette** with all countries but X. Specifying
      **allowVignette** with an empty list is the same as avoiding all toll
      roads with vignettes. Note: It is an error to specify both
      **avoidVignette** and **allowVignette**.

      A GeoJSON MultiPolygon representing list of areas to avoid. Only rectangle
      polygons are supported. The maximum size of a rectangle is about 160x160
      km. Maximum number of avoided areas is **10**. It cannot cross the 180th
      meridian. It must be between -80 and +80 degrees of latitude.

    summary: >-
      A GeoJSON Geometry collection representing sequence of coordinates used as
      input for route reconstruction and for calculating zero or more
      alternative routes to this reference route.
        - The provided sequence of supporting points is used as input for route reconstruction.
        - The alternative routes are calculated between the origin and destination points specified in the base path parameter locations.
        - If both _minDeviationDistance_ and _minDeviationTime_ are set to zero, then these origin and destination points are
        expected to be at (or very near) the beginning and end of the reference route, respectively.
        - Intermediate locations (_waypoints_) are not supported when using <_supportingPoints_>.
        - The reference route may contain traffic incidents of type _ROAD_CLOSURE_, which are
        ignored for the calculation of the reference route's travel time and traffic delay.

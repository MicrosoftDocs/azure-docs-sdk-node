  Trigger that allows the referenced pipeline to depend on other pipeline runs
  based on runDimension Name/Value pairs. Upstream pipelines should declare the
  same runDimension Name and their runs should have the values for those
  runDimensions. The referenced pipeline run would be triggered if the values
  for the runDimension match for all upstream pipeline runs.

      Sets the permissions for the specified share. The permissions indicate

      whether directories or files in a share may be accessed publicly.

      When you set permissions for a share, the existing permissions are

      If no shareAcl provided, the existing share ACL will be

      When you establish a stored access policy on a share, it may take up to 30
      seconds to take effect.

      During this interval, a shared access signature that is associated with
      the stored access policy will

      fail with status code 403 (Forbidden), until the access policy becomes
      active.

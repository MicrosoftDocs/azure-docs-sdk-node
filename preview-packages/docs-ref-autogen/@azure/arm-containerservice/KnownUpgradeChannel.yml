      Automatically upgrade the cluster to the latest supported patch release on
      the latest supported minor version. In cases where the cluster is at a
      version of Kubernetes that is at an N-2 minor version where N is the
      latest supported minor version, the cluster first upgrades to the latest
      supported patch version on N-1 minor version. For example, if a cluster is
      running version 1.17.7 and versions 1.17.9, 1.18.4, 1.18.6, and 1.19.1 are
      available, your cluster first is upgraded to 1.18.6, then is upgraded to
      1.19.1.

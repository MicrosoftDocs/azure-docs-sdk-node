  Known values of

  that the service accepts.

fields:
  - name: Affinity
    uid: '@azure/arm-servicefabric.KnownServiceCorrelationScheme.Affinity'
    package: '@azure/arm-servicefabric'
    summary: >-
      Indicates that this service has an affinity relationship with another
      service. Provided for backwards compatibility, consider preferring the
      Aligned or NonAlignedAffinity options. The value is 1.
  - name: AlignedAffinity
    uid: '@azure/arm-servicefabric.KnownServiceCorrelationScheme.AlignedAffinity'
    package: '@azure/arm-servicefabric'
    summary: >-
      Aligned affinity ensures that the primaries of the partitions of the
      affinitized services are collocated on the same nodes. This is the default
      and is the same as selecting the Affinity scheme. The value is 2.
  - name: Invalid
    uid: '@azure/arm-servicefabric.KnownServiceCorrelationScheme.Invalid'
    package: '@azure/arm-servicefabric'
    summary: An invalid correlation scheme. Cannot be used. The value is zero.
  - name: NonAlignedAffinity
    uid: '@azure/arm-servicefabric.KnownServiceCorrelationScheme.NonAlignedAffinity'
    package: '@azure/arm-servicefabric'
    summary: >-
      Non-Aligned affinity guarantees that all replicas of each service will be
      placed on the same nodes. Unlike Aligned Affinity, this does not guarantee
      that replicas of particular role will be collocated. The value is 3.

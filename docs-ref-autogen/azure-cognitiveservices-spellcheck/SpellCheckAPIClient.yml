Bing often flights new\rfeatures and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning\rtraffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a\ruser across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user to multiple\rconflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead\rto an inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second request has a\rdifferent flight assignment than the first, the experience may be\runexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that\rclient ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the user.

Use the client ID for each Bing\rAPI request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the\rclient ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie\rto ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie.\rFor other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to\rpersist the ID. The next time the user uses your app on that device, get the\rclient ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this\rheader. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use\rit for all subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device.

The latitude\rmust be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0.\rNegative values indicate southern latitudes and positive values indicate\rnorthern latitudes. long (required): The longitude of the client's location,\rin degrees. The longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less\rthan or equal to +180.0. Negative values indicate western longitudes and\rpositive values indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The radius, in\rmeters, which specifies the horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the\rvalue returned by the device's location service. Typical values might be 22m\rfor GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP\rlookup. ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the\rlocation. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1,\r1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading or direction of\rtravel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360,\rcounting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp\rkey is nonzero. sp (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters\rper second, that the client device is traveling. alt (optional): The\raltitude of the client device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in\rmeters, that specifies the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify\rthis key only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are\roptional, the more information that you provide, the more accurate the\rlocation results are. Although optional, you are encouraged to always\rspecify the user's geographical location. Providing the location is\respecially important if the client's IP address does not accurately reflect\rthe user's physical location (for example, if the client uses VPN).

The latitude\rmust be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0.\rNegative values indicate southern latitudes and positive values indicate\rnorthern latitudes. long (required): The longitude of the client's location,\rin degrees.

Negative values indicate western longitudes and\rpositive values indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The radius, in\rmeters, which specifies the horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the\rvalue returned by the device's location service. Typical values might be 22m\rfor GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP\rlookup. ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the\rlocation.

Specify\rthis key only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are\roptional, the more information that you provide, the more accurate the\rlocation results are.

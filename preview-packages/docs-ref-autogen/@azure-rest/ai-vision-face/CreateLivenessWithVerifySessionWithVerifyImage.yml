      A session is best for client device scenarios where developers want to
      authorize a client device to perform only a liveness detection without
      granting full access to their resource. Created sessions have a limited
      life span and only authorize clients to perform the desired action before
      access is expired.


      Permissions includes...

      >

      *
        * Ability to call /detectLivenessWithVerify/singleModal for up to 3 retries.
        * A token lifetime of 10 minutes.

      > [!NOTE]

      >

      > *

      >   * Client access can be revoked by deleting the session using the
      Delete Liveness With Verify Session operation.

      >   * To retrieve a result, use the Get Liveness With Verify Session.

      >   * To audit the individual requests that a client has made to your
      resource, use the List Liveness With Verify Session Audit Entries.


      Alternative Option: Client device submits VerifyImage during the
      /detectLivenessWithVerify/singleModal call.

      > [!NOTE]

      > Extra measures should be taken to validate that the client is sending
      the expected VerifyImage.

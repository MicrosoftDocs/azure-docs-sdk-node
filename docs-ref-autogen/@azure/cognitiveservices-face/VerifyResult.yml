      A number indicates the similarity confidence of whether two faces belong
      to the same person,

      or whether the face belongs to the person. By default, isIdentical is set
      to True if

      similarity confidence is greater than or equal to 0.5. This is useful for
      advanced users to

      override "isIdentical" and fine-tune the result on their own data.

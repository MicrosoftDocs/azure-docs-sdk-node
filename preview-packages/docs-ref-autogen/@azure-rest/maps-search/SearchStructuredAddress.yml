      **Structured Address Geocoding**

      **Applies to:** see pricing [tiers](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPricingTier).


      Azure Address Geocoding can also be accessed for  structured address look
      up exclusively. The geocoding search index will be queried for everything
      above the  street level data. No POIs will be returned. Note that the
      geocoder is very tolerant of typos and incomplete  addresses. It will also
      handle everything from exact  street addresses or street or intersections
      as well as higher level geographies such as city centers,  counties,
      states etc.

      This method will be used to send request that would check the path to
      provide

      strong types. When used by the codegen this type gets overridden with the
      generated

      types. For example:

      ```typescript snippet:ReadmeSamplePathExample

      import { Client } from "@typespec/ts-http-runtime";


      type MyClient = Client & {
        path: Routes;

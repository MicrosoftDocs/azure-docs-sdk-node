      An Epoch is a configuration number for the partition as a whole. When the
      configuration of the

      replica set changes, for example when the Primary replica changes, the
      operations that are

      replicated from the new Primary replica are said to be a new Epoch from
      the ones which were sent

      by the old Primary replica.

      This is the URL of a certificate that has been uploaded to Key Vault as a
      secret. For adding a secret to the Key Vault, see [Add a key or secret to
      the key
      vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/key-vault-get-started/#add).
      In this case, your certificate needs to be the Base64 encoding of the
      following JSON Object which is encoded in UTF-8: <br><br> {<br> 
      "data":"<Base64-encoded-certificate>",<br>  "dataType":"pfx",<br> 
      "password":"<pfx-file-password>"<br>} <br> To install certificates on a
      virtual machine it is recommended to use the [Azure Key Vault virtual
      machine extension for
      Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/key-vault-linux)
      or the [Azure Key Vault virtual machine extension for
      Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/key-vault-windows).

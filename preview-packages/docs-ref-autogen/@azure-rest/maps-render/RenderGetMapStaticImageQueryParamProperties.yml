    package: '@azure-rest/maps-render'
    summary: >
      Path style and locations. Use this parameter to optionally add lines,
      polygons or circles to the image.

      The path style describes the appearance of the line and fill. (Be sure to
      properly URL-encode values of this

      parameter since it will contain reserved characters such as pipes and
      punctuation.)

      Path parameter is supported in Azure Maps account SKU starting with S1.
      Multiple instances of the path parameter

      allow to specify multiple geometries with their styles. Number of
      parameters per request is limited to 10 and

      number of locations is limited to 100 per path.


      To render a circle with radius 100 meters and center point at latitude
      45°N and longitude 122°W using the default style, add the

      querystring parameter


      `path=ra100||-122 45`


      Note that the longitude comes before the latitude.

      After URL encoding this will look like


      `path=ra100%7C%7C-122+45`


      All of the examples here show the path parameter without URL encoding, for
      clarity.


      To render a line, separate each location with a pipe character. For
      example, use


      `path=||-122 45|-119.5 43.2|-121.67 47.12`


      To render a polygon, last location must be equal to the start location.
      For example, use


      `path=||-122 45|-119.5 43.2|-121.67 47.12|-122 45`


      Longitude and latitude values for locations of lines and polygons can be
      in the range from -360 to 360 to allow for rendering of geometries
      crossing the anti-meridian.


      ### Style Modifiers


      You can modify the appearance of the path by adding style modifiers. These
      are added before the locations.

      Style modifiers each have a two-letter name. These abbreviated names are
      used to help reduce the length

      of the URL.


      To change the color of the outline, use the 'lc' style modifier and
      specify the color using the HTML/CSS RGB color

      format which is a six-digit hexadecimal number (the three-digit form is
      not supported). For example, to use

      a deep pink color which you would specify as #FF1493 in CSS, use


      `path=lcFF1493||-122 45|-119.5 43.2`


      Multiple style modifiers may be combined together to create a more complex
      visual style.


      `lc0000FF|lw3|la0.60|fa0.50||-122.2 47.6|-122.2 47.7|-122.3 47.7|-122.3
      47.6|-122.2 47.6`

    summary: >
      Pushpin style and instances. Use this parameter to optionally add pushpins
      to the image.

      The pushpin style describes the appearance of the pushpins, and the
      instances specify

      the coordinates of the pushpins and optional labels for each pin. (Be sure
      to properly URL-encode values of this

      parameter since it will contain reserved characters such as pipes and
      punctuation.)

      The Azure Maps account S0 SKU only supports a single instance of the pins
      parameter. Other SKUs

      allow multiple instances of the pins parameter to specify multiple pin
      styles.


      To render a pushpin at latitude 45°N and longitude 122°W using the default
      built-in pushpin style, add the

      querystring parameter


      `pins=default||-122 45`


      Note that the longitude comes before the latitude.

      After URL encoding this will look like


      `pins=default%7C%7C-122+45`


      All of the examples here show the pins

      parameter without URL encoding, for clarity.


      To render a pin at multiple locations, separate each location with a pipe
      character. For example, use


      `pins=default||-122 45|-119.5 43.2|-121.67 47.12`


      The S0 Azure Maps account SKU only allows five pushpins. Other account
      SKUs do not have this limitation.


      ### Style Modifiers


      You can modify the appearance of the pins by adding style modifiers. These
      are added after the style but before

      the locations and labels. Style modifiers each have a two-letter name.
      These abbreviated names are used to help

      reduce the length of the URL.


      To change the color of the pushpin, use the 'co' style modifier and
      specify the color using the HTML/CSS RGB color

      format which is a six-digit hexadecimal number (the three-digit form is
      not supported). For example, to use

      a deep pink color which you would specify as #FF1493 in CSS, use


      `pins=default|coFF1493||-122 45`


      ### Pushpin Labels


      To add a label to the pins, put the label in single quotes just before the
      coordinates. For example, to label

      three pins with the values '1', '2', and '3', use


      `pins=default||'1'-122 45|'2'-119.5 43.2|'3'-121.67 47.12`


      There is a built in pushpin style called 'none' that does not display a
      pushpin image. You can use this if

      you want to display labels without any pin image. For example,


      `pins=none||'A'-122 45|'B'-119.5 43.2`


      To change the color of the pushpin labels, use the 'lc' label color style
      modifier. For example, to use pink

      pushpins with black labels, use


      `pins=default|coFF1493|lc000000||-122 45`


      To change the size of the labels, use the 'ls' label size style modifier.
      The label size represents the approximate

      height of the label text in pixels. For example, to increase the label
      size to 12, use


      `pins=default|ls12||'A'-122 45|'B'-119 43`


      The labels are centered at the pushpin 'label anchor.' The anchor location
      is predefined for built-in pushpins and

      is at the top center of custom pushpins (see below). To override the label
      anchor, using the 'la' style modifier

      and provide X and Y pixel coordinates for the anchor. These coordinates
      are relative to the top left corner of the

      pushpin image. Positive X values move the anchor to the right, and
      positive Y values move the anchor down. For example,

      to position the label anchor 10 pixels right and 4 pixels above the top
      left corner of the pushpin image,

      use


      `pins=default|la10 -4||'A'-122 45|'B'-119 43`


      ### Custom Pushpins


      To use a custom pushpin image, use the word 'custom' as the pin style
      name, and then specify a URL after the

      location and label information. Use two pipe characters to indicate that
      you're done specifying locations and are

      starting the URL. For example,


      `pins=custom||-122 45||http://contoso.com/pushpins/red.png`


      After URL encoding, this would look like


      `pins=custom%7C%7C-122+45%7C%7Chttp%3A%2F%2Fcontoso.com%2Fpushpins%2Fred.png`


      By default, custom pushpin images are drawn centered at the pin
      coordinates. This usually isn't ideal as it obscures

      the location that you're trying to highlight. To override the anchor
      location of the pin image, use the 'an'

      style modifier. This uses the same format as the 'la' label anchor style
      modifier. For example, if your custom

      pin image has the tip of the pin at the top left corner of the image, you
      can set the anchor to that spot by

      using


      `pins=custom|an0 0||-122 45||http://contoso.com/pushpins/red.png`


      Note: If you use the 'co' color modifier with a custom pushpin image, the
      specified color will replace the RGB

      channels of the pixels in the image but will leave the alpha (opacity)
      channel unchanged. This would usually

      only be done with a solid-color custom image.


      ### Scale, Rotation, and Opacity


      You can make pushpins and their labels larger or smaller by using the 'sc'
      scale style modifier. This is a

      value greater than zero. A value of 1 is the standard scale. Values larger
      than 1 will make the pins larger, and

      values smaller than 1 will make them smaller. For example, to draw the
      pushpins 50% larger than normal, use


      `pins=default|sc1.5||-122 45`


      You can rotate pushpins and their labels by using the 'ro' rotation style
      modifier. This is a number of degrees

      of clockwise rotation. Use a negative number to rotate counter-clockwise.
      For example, to rotate the pushpins

      90 degrees clockwise and double their size, use


      `pins=default|ro90|sc2||-122 45`


      You can make pushpins and their labels partially transparent by specifying
      the 'al' alpha style modifier.

      This is a number between 0 and 1 indicating the opacity of the pushpins.
      Zero makes them completely transparent

      (and not visible) and 1 makes them completely opaque (which is the
      default). For example, to make pushpins

      and their labels only 67% opaque, use


      `pins=default|al.67||-122 45`


      ### Style Modifier Summary


      Modifier  | Description     | Range

      :--------:|-----------------|------------------

      al        | Alpha (opacity) | 0 to 1

      an        | Pin anchor      | *

      sc        | Scale           | Greater than 0


      * X and Y coordinates can be anywhere within pin image or a margin around
      it.

      The margin size is the minimum of the pin width and height.

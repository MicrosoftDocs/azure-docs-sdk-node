  Batch will retry Tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a Node.
  Examples of recovery

  operations include (but are not limited to) when an unhealthy Node is rebooted
  or a Compute Node

  disappeared due to host failure. Retries due to recovery operations are
  independent of and are

  not counted against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the maxTaskRetryCount is 0,
  an internal retry

  due to a recovery operation may occur. Because of this, all Tasks should be
  idempotent. This

  means Tasks need to tolerate being interrupted and restarted without causing
  any corruption or

  duplicate data. The best practice for long running Tasks is to use some form
  of checkpointing.

      the Node, and is up

      to date, then it is not re-downloaded; the existing copy on the Compute
      Node is used. If a

      referenced Package cannot be installed, for example because the package
      has been deleted or

      because download failed, the Task fails.

      The settings for an authentication token that the Task can use to perform
      Batch service

      operations. If this property is set, the Batch service provides the Task
      with an

      authentication token which can be used to authenticate Batch service
      operations without

      requiring an Account access key. The token is provided via the
      AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN

      environment variable. The operations that the Task can carry out using the
      token depend on the

      settings. For example, a Task can request Job permissions in order to add
      other Tasks to the

      Job, or check the status of the Job or of other Tasks under the Job.

      command line. The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore

      of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to
      take advantage of

      such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for
      example using "cmd /c

      MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the command
      line refers to file

      paths, it should use a relative path (relative to the Task working
      directory), or use the

      Batch provided environment variable

      (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).

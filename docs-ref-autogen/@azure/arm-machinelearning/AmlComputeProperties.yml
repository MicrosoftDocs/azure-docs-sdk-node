      Allocation state of the compute. Possible values are: steady - Indicates
      that the compute is not resizing. There are no changes to the number of
      compute nodes in the compute in progress. A compute enters this state when
      it is created and when no operations are being performed on the compute to
      change the number of compute nodes. resizing - Indicates that the compute
      is resizing; that is, compute nodes are being added to or removed from the
      compute.

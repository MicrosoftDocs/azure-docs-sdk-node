    summary: >-
      Index is updated synchronously with a create or update operation.


      With consistent indexing, query behavior is the same as the default
      consistency level for the container.

      The index is always kept up to date with the data.

    uid: '@azure/cosmos.IndexingMode.lazy'
    package: '@azure/cosmos'
    summary: >-
      Index is updated asynchronously with respect to a create or update
      operation.


      With lazy indexing, queries are eventually consistent. The index is
      updated when the container is idle.
  - name: none

    summary: No Index is provided.

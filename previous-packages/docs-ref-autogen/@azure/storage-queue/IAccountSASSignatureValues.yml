  ONLY AVAILABLE IN NODE.JS RUNTIME.

  IAccountSASSignatureValues is used to generate a Shared Access Signature (SAS)
  for an Azure Storage account. Once

  all the values here are set appropriately, call generateSASQueryParameters()
  to obtain a representation of the SAS

  which can actually be applied to queue urls. Note: that both this class and
  <xref:@azure/storage-queue.SASQueryParameters> exist because

  the former is mutable and a logical representation while the latter is
  immutable and used to generate actual REST

  requests.

  for more conceptual information on SAS

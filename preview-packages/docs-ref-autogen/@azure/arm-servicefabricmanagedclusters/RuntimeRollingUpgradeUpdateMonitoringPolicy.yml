      The compensating action to perform when a Monitored upgrade encounters
      monitoring policy or health policy violations. Invalid indicates the
      failure action is invalid. Rollback specifies that the upgrade will start
      rolling back automatically. Manual indicates that the upgrade will switch
      to UnmonitoredManual upgrade mode

      The maximum amount of time to block processing of an upgrade domain and
      prevent loss of availability when there are unexpected issues. When this
      timeout expires, processing of the upgrade domain will proceed regardless

      upgrade domain. Valid values are between 0 and 42949672925 inclusive.

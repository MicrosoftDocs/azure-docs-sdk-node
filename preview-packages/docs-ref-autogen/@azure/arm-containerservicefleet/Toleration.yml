      Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all
      taint keys. If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination

    summary: >-
      Operator represents a key's relationship to the value. Valid operators are
      Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal. Exists is equivalent to wildcard for
      value, so that a ClusterResourcePlacement can tolerate all taints of a
      particular category.

    summary: >-
      Value is the taint value the toleration matches to. If the operator is
      Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.

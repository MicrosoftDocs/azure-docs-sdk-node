      The configuration for data disks attached to the Compute Nodes in the
      Pool. This property must be specified if the Compute Nodes in the Pool
      need to have empty data disks attached to them. This cannot be updated.
      Each Compute Node gets its own disk (the disk is not a file share).
      Existing disks cannot be attached, each attached disk is empty. When the
      Compute Node is removed from the Pool, the disk and all data associated
      with it is also deleted. The disk is not formatted after being attached,
      it must be formatted before use - for more information see

      between the Compute Node and the Batch service. There are different
      implementations of the Compute Node agent, known as SKUs, for different
      operating systems. You must specify a Compute Node agent SKU which matches
      the selected Image reference. To get the list of supported Compute Node
      agent SKUs along with their list of verified Image references, see the

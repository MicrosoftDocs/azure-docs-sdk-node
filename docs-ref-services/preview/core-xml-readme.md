# Azure Core XML client library for JavaScript - version 1.0.0-beta.1 
 (Experimental)

This library is primarily intended to be used in code generated by [AutoRest](https://github.com/Azure/Autorest) and [`autorest.typescript`](https://github.com/Azure/autorest.typescript) for APIs that require parsing XML payloads.

## Getting started

### Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version > 8.x

### Installation

This package is primarily used in generated code and not meant to be consumed directly by end users.

## Key concepts

XML parsing is mostly delegated to the browser and `xml2js`.

## Examples

Examples can be found in the `samples` folder.

## Next steps

See `@azure/core-client` for actual usage.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into issues while using this library, please feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/issues/new).

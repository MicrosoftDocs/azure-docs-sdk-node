    package: '@azure/arm-recoveryservicesdatareplication'
    summary: >-
      NIC configuration overridden by user. Differs from SelectedByUser in the
      sense that the legacy SelectedByUser is used both for explicit
      modification by user and implicit approval of user if the settings are
      used for TFO/FO. SelectedByUserOverride implies user overriding at least
      one of the configurations.

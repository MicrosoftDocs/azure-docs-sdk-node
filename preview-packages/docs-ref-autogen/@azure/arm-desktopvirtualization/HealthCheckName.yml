  <xref:@azure/arm-desktopvirtualization.KnownHealthCheckName> can be used
  interchangeably with HealthCheckName,
   this enum contains the known values that the service supports.
  ### Known values supported by the service

  **DomainJoinedCheck**: Verifies the SessionHost is joined to a domain. If this
  check fails is classified as fatal as no connection can succeed if the
  SessionHost is not joined to the domain. \

  **DomainTrustCheck**: Verifies the SessionHost is not experiencing domain
  trust issues that will prevent authentication on SessionHost at connection
  time when session is created. If this check fails is classified as fatal as no
  connection can succeed if we cannot reach the domain for authentication on the
  SessionHost. \

  **FSLogixHealthCheck**: Verifies the FSLogix service is up and running to make
  sure users' profiles are loaded in the session. If this check fails is
  classified as fatal as even if the connection can succeed, user experience is
  bad as the user profile cannot be loaded and user will get a temporary profile
  in the session. \

  **SxSStackListenerCheck**: Verifies that the SxS stack is up and running so
  connections can succeed. If this check fails is classified as fatal as no
  connection can succeed if the SxS stack is not ready. \

  **UrlsAccessibleCheck**: Verifies that the required WVD service and Geneva
  URLs are reachable from the SessionHost. These URLs are: RdTokenUri,
  RdBrokerURI, RdDiagnosticsUri and storage blob URLs for agent monitoring
  (geneva). If this check fails, it is non fatal and the machine still can
  service connections, main issue may be that monitoring agent is unable to
  store warm path data (logs, operations ...). \

  **MonitoringAgentCheck**: Verifies that the required Geneva agent is running.
  If this check fails, it is non fatal and the machine still can service
  connections, main issue may be that monitoring agent is missing or running
  (possibly) older version. \

  **DomainReachable**: Verifies the domain the SessionHost is joined to is still
  reachable. If this check fails is classified as fatal as no connection can
  succeed if the domain the SessionHost is joined is not reachable at the time
  of connection. \

  **WebRTCRedirectorCheck**: Verifies whether the WebRTCRedirector component is
  healthy. The WebRTCRedirector component is used to optimize video and audio
  performance in Microsoft Teams. This checks whether the component is still
  running, and whether there is a higher version available. If this check fails,
  it is non fatal and the machine still can service connections, main issue may
  be the WebRTCRedirector component has to be restarted or updated. \

  **SupportedEncryptionCheck**: Verifies the value of SecurityLayer registration
  key. If the value is 0 (SecurityLayer.RDP) this check fails with Error code =
  NativeMethodErrorCode.E_FAIL and is fatal. If the value is 1
  (SecurityLayer.Negotiate) this check fails with Error code =
  NativeMethodErrorCode.ERROR_SUCCESS and is non fatal. \

  **MetaDataServiceCheck**: Verifies the metadata service is accessible and
  return compute properties. \

  **AppAttachHealthCheck**: Verifies that the AppAttachService is healthy (there
  were no issues during package staging). The AppAttachService is used to enable
  the staging\/registration (and eventual deregistration\/destaging) of MSIX
  apps that have been set up by the tenant admin. This checks whether the
  component had any failures during package staging. Failures in staging will
  prevent some MSIX apps from working properly for the end user. If this check
  fails, it is non fatal and the machine still can service connections, main
  issue may be certain apps will not work for end-users.

      StartupProbe indicates that the App Instance has successfully initialized.
      If specified, no other probes are executed until this completes
      successfully. If this probe fails, the Pod will be restarted, just as if
      the livenessProbe failed. This can be used to provide different probe
      parameters at the beginning of a App Instance's lifecycle, when it might
      take a long time to load data or warm a cache, than during steady-state
      operation. This cannot be updated. More info:

    summary: >-
      Optional duration in seconds the App Instance needs to terminate
      gracefully. May be decreased in delete request. Value must be non-negative
      integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via the kill signal (no
      opportunity to shut down). If this value is nil, the default grace period
      will be used instead. The grace period is the duration in seconds after
      the processes running in the App Instance are sent a termination signal
      and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal.
      Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process.
      Defaults to 90 seconds.

    summary: >-
      Default oversampling factor. Oversampling will internally request more
      documents (specified by this multiplier) in the initial search. This
      increases the set of results that will be reranked using recomputed
      similarity scores from full-precision vectors. Minimum value is 1, meaning
      no oversampling (1x). This parameter can only be set when
      rerankWithOriginalVectors is true. Higher values improve recall at the
      expense of latency.

      If set to true, once the ordered set of results calculated using

      recall at the expense of latency.

    uid: '@azure/search-documents.BaseVectorSearchCompression.truncationDimension'
    package: '@azure/search-documents'
    summary: >-
      The number of dimensions to truncate the vectors to. Truncating the
      vectors reduces the size of the vectors and the amount of data that needs
      to be transferred during search. This can save storage cost and improve
      search performance at the expense of recall. It should be only used for
      embeddings trained with Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) such as
      OpenAI text-embedding-3-large (small). The default value is null, which
      means no truncation.

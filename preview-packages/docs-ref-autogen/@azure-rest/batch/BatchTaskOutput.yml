  Batch will retry Tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a Node.
  Examples of recovery operations include (but are not limited to) when an
  unhealthy Node is rebooted or a Compute Node disappeared due to host failure.
  Retries due to recovery operations are independent of and are not counted
  against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the maxTaskRetryCount is 0, an internal
  retry due to a recovery operation may occur. Because of this, all Tasks should
  be idempotent. This means Tasks need to tolerate being interrupted and
  restarted without causing any corruption or duplicate data. The best practice
  for long running Tasks is to use some form of checkpointing.

      Batch service operations. If this property is set, the Batch service

      authenticate Batch service operations without requiring an Account access
      key. The token is provided via the AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN
      environment variable. The operations that the Task can carry out using the
      token depend on the settings. For example, a Task can request Job
      permissions in order to add other Tasks to the Job, or check the status of
      the Job or of other Tasks under the Job.

      features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take
      advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command
      line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c
      MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should
      use a relative path (relative to the Task working directory), or use the

    summary: >-
      The virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as the
      Azure Batch account. The specified subnet should have enough free IP
      addresses to accommodate the number of nodes in the pool. If the subnet
      doesn't have enough free IP addresses, the pool will partially allocate
      compute nodes and a resize error will occur. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch'
      service principal must have the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor'
      Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) role for the specified VNet. The
      specified subnet must allow communication from the Azure Batch service to
      be able to schedule tasks on the compute nodes. This can be verified by
      checking if the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups
      (NSG). If communication to the compute nodes in the specified subnet is
      denied by an NSG, then the Batch service will set the state of the compute
      nodes to unusable. If the specified VNet has any associated Network
      Security Groups (NSG), then a few reserved system ports must be enabled
      for inbound communication. For pools created with a virtual machine
      configuration, enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well as port 22 for Linux
      and port 3389 for Windows. For pools created with a cloud service
      configuration, enable ports 10100, 20100, and 30100. Also enable outbound
      connections to Azure Storage on port 443. For cloudServiceConfiguration
      pools, only 'classic' VNETs are supported. For more details see:

      This property applies only to files being downloaded to Linux compute
      nodes. It

      will be ignored if it is specified for a resourceFile which will be
      downloaded to a Windows

      node. If this property is not specified for a Linux node, then a default
      value of 0770 is

      applied to the file.

      If the httpUrl property is specified, the filePath is required and

      path which the file will be downloaded to, including the filename.
      Otherwise, if the

      autoStorageContainerName or storageContainerUrl property is specified,
      filePath is optional

      and is the directory to download the files to. In the case where filePath
      is used as a

      directory, any directory structure already associated with the input data
      will be retained in

      full and appended to the specified filePath directory. The specified
      relative path cannot

      break out of the task's working directory (for example by using '..').

      credentials when downloading the blob. There are two ways to get such a
      URL for a blob in

      Azure storage: include a Shared Access Signature (SAS) granting read

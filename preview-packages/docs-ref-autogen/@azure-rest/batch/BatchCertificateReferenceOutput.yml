    summary: >-
      The location of the Certificate store on the Compute Node into which to
      install the Certificate. The default value is currentuser. This property
      is applicable only for Pools configured with Windows Compute Nodes (that
      is, created with cloudServiceConfiguration, or with
      virtualMachineConfiguration using a Windows Image reference). For Linux
      Compute Nodes, the Certificates are stored in a directory inside the Task
      working directory and an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is
      supplied to the Task to query for this location. For Certificates with
      visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs' directory is created in the user's
      home directory (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and Certificates are placed
      in that directory.


      Possible values: "currentuser", "localmachine"

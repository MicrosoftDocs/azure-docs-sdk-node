    summary: >-
      The drain timeout for a node. The amount of time (in minutes) to wait on
      eviction of pods and graceful termination per node. This eviction wait
      time honors waiting on pod disruption budgets. If this time is exceeded,
      the upgrade fails. If not specified, the default is 30 minutes.

    summary: >-
      The maximum number or percentage of extra nodes that are allowed to be
      blocked in the agent pool during an upgrade when undrainable node behavior
      is Cordon. This can either be set to an integer (e.g. '5') or a percentage
      (e.g. '50%'). If a percentage is specified, it is the percentage of the
      total agent pool size at the time of the upgrade. For percentages,
      fractional nodes are rounded up. If not specified, the default is
      maxSurge. This must always be greater than or equal to maxSurge. For more

      nodes are rounded up. If not specified, the default is 10%. For more

    summary: >-
      The maximum number or percentage of nodes that can be simultaneously
      unavailable during upgrade. This can either be set to an integer (e.g.
      '1') or a percentage (e.g. '5%'). If a percentage is specified, it is the
      percentage of the total agent pool size at the time of the upgrade. For
      percentages, fractional nodes are rounded up. If not specified, the
      default is 0. For more information, including best practices, see:

      Defines the behavior for undrainable nodes during upgrade. The most common
      cause of undrainable nodes is Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs), but other
      issues, such as pod termination grace period is exceeding the remaining
      per-node drain timeout or pod is still being in a running state, can also
      cause undrainable nodes.

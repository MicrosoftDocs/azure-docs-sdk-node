      A comma-separated list of names defining the group of languages to return.

      Allowed group names are: `translation`, `transliteration` and
      `dictionary`.

      If no scope is given, then all groups are returned, which is equivalent to
      passing

      `scope=translation,transliteration,dictionary`. To decide which set of
      supported languages

      is appropriate for your scenario, see the description of the [response
      object](#response-body).

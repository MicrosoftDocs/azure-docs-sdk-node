      only if the Task is in the completed state. The exit code for a process
      reflects the specific

      you use the exit code

      value to make decisions in your code, be sure that you know the exit code
      convention used by

      the application process. Note that the exit code may also be generated by
      the Compute Node

      operating system, such as when a process is forcibly terminated.

      If present, this is

      typically the same as startTime, but may be different if the Task has been
      restarted for

      reasons other than retry; for example, if the Compute Node was rebooted
      during a retry, then

      the startTime is updated but the lastRetryTime is not.

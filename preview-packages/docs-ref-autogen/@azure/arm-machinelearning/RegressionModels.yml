  Defines values for RegressionModels. \

  [KnownRegressionModels](xref:@azure/arm-machinelearning.KnownRegressionModels)
  can be used interchangeably with RegressionModels,
   this enum contains the known values that the service supports.
  ### Known values supported by the service

  **ElasticNet**: Elastic net is a popular type of regularized linear regression
  that combines two popular penalties, specifically the L1 and L2 penalty
  functions. \

  **GradientBoosting**: The technique of transiting week learners into a strong
  learner is called Boosting. The gradient boosting algorithm process works on
  this theory of execution. \

  **DecisionTree**: Decision Trees are a non-parametric supervised learning
  method used for both classification and regression tasks.

  The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by
  learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features. \

  **KNN**: K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm uses 'feature similarity' to
  predict the values of new datapoints

  which further means that the new data point will be assigned a value based on
  how closely it matches the points in the training set. \

  **LassoLars**: Lasso model fit with Least Angle Regression a.k.a. Lars. It is
  a Linear Model trained with an L1 prior as regularizer. \

  **SGD**: SGD: Stochastic gradient descent is an optimization algorithm often
  used in machine learning applications

  to find the model parameters that correspond to the best fit between predicted
  and actual outputs.

  It's an inexact but powerful technique. \

  **RandomForest**: Random forest is a supervised learning algorithm.

  The "forest" it builds, is an ensemble of decision trees, usually trained with
  the “bagging” method.

  The general idea of the bagging method is that a combination of learning
  models increases the overall result. \

  **ExtremeRandomTrees**: Extreme Trees is an ensemble machine learning
  algorithm that combines the predictions from many decision trees. It is
  related to the widely used random forest algorithm. \

  **LightGBM**: LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree based
  learning algorithms. \

  **XGBoostRegressor**: XGBoostRegressor: Extreme Gradient Boosting Regressor is
  a supervised machine learning model using ensemble of base learners.

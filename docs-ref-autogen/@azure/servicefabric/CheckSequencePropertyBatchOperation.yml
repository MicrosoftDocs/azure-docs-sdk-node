  Compares the Sequence Number of a property with the SequenceNumber argument.

  A property's sequence number can be thought of as that property's version.

  Every time the property is modified, its sequence number is increased.

  The sequence number can be found in a property's metadata.

  The comparison fails if the sequence numbers are not equal.

  CheckSequencePropertyBatchOperation is generally used as a precondition for
  the write operations

  in the batch.

  Note that if one PropertyBatchOperation in a PropertyBatch fails,

  the entire batch fails and cannot be committed in a transactional manner.

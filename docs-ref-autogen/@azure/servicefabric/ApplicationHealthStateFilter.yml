  One filter can match zero, one or multiple applications, depending on its

      The name of the application that matches the filter, as a fabric uri. The
      filter is applied

      only to the specified application, if it exists.

      If the application doesn't exist, no application is returned in the
      cluster health chunk based

      on this filter.

      If the application exists, it is included in the cluster health chunk if
      it respects the other

      filter properties.

      If not specified, all applications are matched against the other filter
      members, like health

      state filter.

      The name of the application type that matches the filter.

      If specified, the filter is applied only to applications of the selected
      application type, if

      any exists.

      If no applications of the specified application type exists, no
      application is returned in the

      cluster health chunk based on this filter.

      Each application of the specified application type is included in the
      cluster health chunk if

      it respects the other filter properties.

      If not specified, all applications are matched against the other filter
      members, like health

      Defines a list of filters that specify which deployed applications to be
      included in the

      returned cluster health chunk as children of the application. The deployed
      applications are

      returned only if the parent application matches a filter.

      If the list is empty, no deployed applications are returned. All the
      deployed applications are

      used to evaluate the parent application aggregated health state,
      regardless of the input

      filters.

      The application filter may specify multiple deployed application filters.

      For example, it can specify a filter to return all deployed applications
      with health state

      Error and another filter to always include a deployed application on a
      specified node.

      The filter for the health state of the applications. It allows selecting
      applications if they

      match the desired health states.

      The possible values are integer value of one of the following health
      states. Only applications

      that match the filter are returned. All applications are used to evaluate
      the cluster

      aggregated health state.

      If not specified, default value is None, unless the application name or
      the application type

      name are specified. If the filter has default value and application name
      is specified, the

      matching application is returned.

      The state values are flag-based enumeration, so the value could be a
      combination of these

      values obtained using bitwise 'OR' operator.

      For example, if the provided value is 6, it matches applications with
      HealthState value of OK

      (2) and Warning (4).

      - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.

      - None - Filter that doesn't match any HealthState value. Used in order to
      return no results

      on a given collection of states. The value is 1.

      - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is
      2.

      - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The
      value is 4.

      - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The
      value is 8.

      - All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is
      65535. Default

      value: 0.

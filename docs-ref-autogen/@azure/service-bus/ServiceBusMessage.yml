      Maximum length is 128 characters. For [partitioned
      entities](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-partitioning),

      setting this value enables assigning related messages to the same internal
      partition,

      so that submission sequence order is correctly recorded. The partition is
      chosen by a hash

      function over this value and cannot be chosen directly.

      - For session-aware entities, the `sessionId` property overrides this
      value.

      - For non partitioned entities, partition key will be ignored

      The address of an entity to send replies to. This optional and

      application-defined value is a standard way to express a reply path to the
      receiver of the

      message. When a sender expects a reply, it sets the value to the absolute
      or relative path of

      the queue or topic it expects the reply to be sent to. See

      The date and time in UTC at which the message will

      be enqueued. This property returns the time in UTC; when setting the
      property, the

      supplied DateTime value must also be in UTC. This value is for delayed
      message sending.

      It is utilized to delay messages sending to a specific time in the future.
      Message enqueuing

      time does not mean that the message will be sent at the same time. It will
      get enqueued,

      but the actual sending time depends on the queue's workload and its state.

      length is 128 characters. For session-aware entities, this
      application-defined value specifies

      the session affiliation of the message. Messages with the same session
      identifier are subject

      to summary locking and enable exact in-order processing and
      demultiplexing. For

      session-unaware entities, this value is ignored.

      message has been

      accepted and stored by the broker, as captured in `enqueuedTimeUtc`. When
      not set explicitly,

      the assumed value is the DefaultTimeToLive for the respective queue or
      topic. A message-level

      `timeToLive` value cannot be longer than the entity's DefaultTimeToLive
      setting and it is

      silently adjusted if it does. See

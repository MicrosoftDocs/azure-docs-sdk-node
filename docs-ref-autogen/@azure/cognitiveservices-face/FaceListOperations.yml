      Add a face to a specified face list, up to 1,000 faces.

      <br /> To deal with an image contains multiple faces, input face can be
      specified as an image

      with a targetFace rectangle. It returns a persistedFaceId representing the
      added face. No image

      will be stored. Only the extracted face feature will be stored on server
      until [FaceList -

      Delete
      Face](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/face/facelist/deleteface)
      or

      [FaceList -
      Delete](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/face/facelist/delete)

      is called.

      <br /> Note persistedFaceId is different from faceId generated by [Face -

      Detect](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/face/face/detectwithurl).

      * Higher face image quality means better detection and recognition
      precision. Please consider

      high-quality faces: frontal, clear, and face size is 200x200 pixels (100
      pixels between eyes) or

      bigger.

      * JPEG, PNG, GIF (the first frame), and BMP format are supported. The
      allowed image file size is

      from 1KB to 6MB.

      * "targetFace" rectangle should contain one face. Zero or multiple faces
      will be regarded as an

      error. If the provided "targetFace" rectangle is not returned from [Face -

      Detect](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/face/face/detectwithurl),
      there’s

      no guarantee to detect and add the face successfully.

      * Out of detectable face size (36x36 - 4096x4096 pixels), large head-pose,
      or large occlusions

      will cause failures.

      * Adding/deleting faces to/from a same face list are processed
      sequentially and to/from

      different face lists are in parallel.

      * The minimum detectable face size is 36x36 pixels in an image no larger
      than 1920x1080 pixels.

      Images with dimensions higher than 1920x1080 pixels will need a
      proportionally larger minimum

      face size.

      * Different 'detectionModel' values can be provided. To use and compare
      different detection

      models, please refer to [How to specify a detection

      model](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/face/face-api-how-to-topics/specify-detection-model)

      <br /> Face list is a list of faces, up to 1,000 faces, and used by [Face

      Similar](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/face/face/findsimilar).

      <br /> After creation, user should use [FaceList - Add

      until [FaceList -

      Delete](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/face/facelist/delete)
      is called.

      <br /> Find Similar is used for scenario like finding celebrity-like
      faces, similar face

      filtering, or as a light way face identification. But if the actual use is
      to identify person,

      please use
      [PersonGroup](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/face/persongroup)

      /

      [LargePersonGroup](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/face/largepersongroup)

      <br /> Please consider

      [LargeFaceList](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/face/largefacelist)
      when

      the face number is large. It can support up to 1,000,000 faces.

      <br />'recognitionModel' should be specified to associate with this face
      list. The default value

      for 'recognitionModel' is 'recognition_01', if the latest model needed,
      please explicitly

      specify the model you need in this parameter. New faces that are added to
      an existing face list

      will use the recognition model that's already associated with the
      collection. Existing face

      features in a face list can't be updated to features extracted by another
      version of recognition

      model.

      * 'recognition_01': The default recognition model for [FaceList-

      Create](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/face/facelist/create).
      All those

      face lists created before 2019 March are bonded with this recognition
      model.

      * 'recognition_02': Recognition model released in 2019 March.

      * 'recognition_03': Recognition model released in 2020 May.
      'recognition_03' is recommended

      since its overall accuracy is improved compared with 'recognition_01' and
      'recognition_02'.

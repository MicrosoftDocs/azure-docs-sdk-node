      Oversampling factor. Minimum value is 1. It overrides the

      configured in the index definition. It can be set only when

      true. This parameter is only permitted when a compression method is used
      on the underlying

      vector field.

    summary: >-
      Relative weight of the vector query when compared to other vector query
      and/or the text query within the same search request. This value is used
      when combining the results of multiple ranking lists produced by the
      different vector queries and/or the results retrieved through the text
      query. The higher the weight, the higher the documents that matched that
      query will be in the final ranking. Default is 1.0 and the value needs to
      be a positive number larger than zero.

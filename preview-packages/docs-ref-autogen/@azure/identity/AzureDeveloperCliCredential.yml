  Azure Developer CLI is a command-line interface tool that allows developers to
  create, manage, and deploy

  resources in Azure. It's built on top of the Azure CLI and provides additional
  functionality specific

  to Azure developers. It allows users to authenticate as a user and/or a
  service principal against

  <a
  href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/">Microsoft
  Entra ID</a>. The

  AzureDeveloperCliCredential authenticates in a development environment and
  acquires a token on behalf of

  the logged-in user or service principal in the Azure Developer CLI. It acts as
  the Azure Developer CLI logged in user or

  service principal and executes an Azure CLI command underneath to authenticate
  the application against

  Microsoft Entra ID.


  <h2> Configure AzureDeveloperCliCredential </h2>


  To use this credential, the developer needs to authenticate locally in Azure
  Developer CLI using one of the

  commands below:


  <ol>
      <li>Run "azd auth login" in Azure Developer CLI to authenticate interactively as a user.</li>
      <li>Run "azd auth login --client-id clientID --client-secret clientSecret
      --tenant-id tenantID" to authenticate as a service principal.</li>
  </ol>


  You may need to repeat this process after a certain time period, depending on
  the refresh token validity in your

  organization. Generally, the refresh token validity period is a few weeks to a
  few months.

  AzureDeveloperCliCredential will prompt you to sign in again.

      AKS will cordon the blocked nodes and replace them with surge nodes during
      upgrade. The blocked nodes will be cordoned and replaced by surge nodes.
      The blocked nodes will have label
      'kubernetes.azure.com/upgrade-status:Quarantined'. A surge node will be
      retained for each blocked node. A best-effort attempt will be made to
      delete all other surge nodes. If there are enough surge nodes to replace
      blocked nodes, then the upgrade operation and the managed cluster will be
      in failed state. Otherwise, the upgrade operation and the managed cluster
      will be in canceled state.

      upgraded. A best-effort attempt will be made to delete all surge nodes.
      The upgrade operation and the managed cluster will be in failed state if
      there are any blocked nodes.

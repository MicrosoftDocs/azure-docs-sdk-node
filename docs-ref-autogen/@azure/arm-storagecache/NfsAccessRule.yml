      Filter applied to the scope for this rule. The filter's format depends on
      its scope. 'default' scope matches all clients and has no filter value.
      'network' scope takes a filter in CIDR format (for example, 10.99.1.0/24).
      'host' takes an IP address or fully qualified domain name as filter. If a
      client does not match any filter rule and there is no default rule, access
      is denied.

summary: >
  The `EventHubConsumerClient` class is used to consume events from an Event
  Hub.

  There are multiple ways to create an `EventHubConsumerClient`

  - Use the connection string from the SAS policy created for your Event Hub
  instance.

  - Use the connection string from the SAS policy created for your Event Hub
  namespace,

  and the name of the Event Hub instance

  - Use the full namespace like `<yournamespace>.servicebus.windows.net`, and a
  credentials object.


  Optionally, you can also pass:

  - An options bag to configure the retry policy or proxy settings.

  - A checkpoint store that is used by the client to read checkpoints to
  determine the position from where it should

  resume receiving events when your application gets restarted. The checkpoint
  store is also used by the client

  to load balance multiple instances of your application.

            Most common are `maxBatchSize` and `maxWaitTimeInSeconds` that

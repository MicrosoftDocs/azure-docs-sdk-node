      to finish. The start

      time for SAS is optional and recommended to not be specified.

      This

      means that the operation might retrieve more logs than have been requested
      since the entire

      log file is always uploaded, but the operation should not retrieve fewer
      logs than have been

      requested. If omitted, the default is to upload all logs available after
      the startTime.

      Whether this pool should enable accelerated networking. Accelerated
      networking enables single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to a VM, which
      may lead to improved networking performance. For more details, see:

    summary: >-
      The ARM resource identifier of the virtual network subnet which the
      Compute Nodes of the Pool will join. The virtual network must be in the
      same region and subscription as the Azure Batch Account. The specified
      subnet should have enough free IP addresses to accommodate the number of
      Compute Nodes in the Pool. If the subnet doesn't have enough free IP
      addresses, the Pool will partially allocate Nodes and a resize error will
      occur. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service principal must have the 'Classic
      Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) role for the
      specified VNet. The specified subnet must allow communication from the
      Azure Batch service to be able to schedule Tasks on the Nodes. This can be
      verified by checking if the specified VNet has any associated Network
      Security Groups (NSG). If communication to the Nodes in the specified
      subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch service will set the state of
      the Compute Nodes to unusable. Only ARM virtual networks
      ('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks') are supported. If the specified VNet
      has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG), then a few reserved
      system ports must be enabled for inbound communication. Enable ports 29876
      and 29877, as well as port 22 for Linux and port 3389 for Windows. Also
      enable outbound connections to Azure Storage on port 443. For more details

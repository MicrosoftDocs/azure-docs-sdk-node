    summary: >-
      Specifies the speed-dependent component of consumption.


      Provided as an unordered list of speed/consumption-rate pairs. The list
      defines points on a consumption curve. Consumption rates for speeds not in
      the list are found as follows:


      * by linear interpolation, if the given speed lies in between two speeds
      in the list


      * by linear extrapolation otherwise, assuming a constant
      (ΔConsumption/ΔSpeed) determined by the nearest two points in the list


      The list must contain between 1 and 25 points (inclusive), and may not
      contain duplicate points for the same speed. If it only contains a single
      point, then the consumption rate of that point is used without further
      processing.


      Consumption specified for the largest speed must be greater than or equal
      to that of the penultimate largest speed. This ensures that extrapolation
      does not lead to negative consumption rates.


      Similarly, consumption values specified for the two smallest speeds in the
      list cannot lead to a negative consumption rate for any smaller  speed.


      The valid range for the consumption values(expressed in kWh/100km) is

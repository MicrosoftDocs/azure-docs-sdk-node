  ### Known values supported by the service

  **LogisticRegression**: Logistic regression is a fundamental classification
  technique.

  It belongs to the group of linear classifiers and is somewhat similar to
  polynomial and linear regression.

  Logistic regression is fast and relatively uncomplicated, and it's convenient
  for you to interpret the results.

  Although it's essentially a method for binary classification, it can also be
  applied to multiclass problems. \

  **SGD**: SGD: Stochastic gradient descent is an optimization algorithm often
  used in machine learning applications

  to find the model parameters that correspond to the best fit between predicted
  and actual outputs. \

  **MultinomialNaiveBayes**: The multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is suitable
  for classification with discrete features (e.g., word counts for text
  classification).

  The multinomial distribution normally requires integer feature counts.
  However, in practice, fractional counts such as tf-idf may also work. \

  **BernoulliNaiveBayes**: Naive Bayes classifier for multivariate Bernoulli
  models. \

  **SVM**: A support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning model
  that uses classification algorithms for two-group classification problems.

  After giving an SVM model sets of labeled training data for each category,
  they're able to categorize new text. \

  **LinearSVM**: A support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning
  model that uses classification algorithms for two-group classification
  problems.

  After giving an SVM model sets of labeled training data for each category,
  they're able to categorize new text.

  Linear SVM performs best when input data is linear, i.e., data can be easily
  classified by drawing the straight line between classified values on a plotted
  graph. \

  **KNN**: K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm uses 'feature similarity' to
  predict the values of new datapoints

  which further means that the new data point will be assigned a value based on
  how closely it matches the points in the training set. \

  **DecisionTree**: Decision Trees are a non-parametric supervised learning
  method used for both classification and regression tasks.

  The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by
  learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features. \

  **RandomForest**: Random forest is a supervised learning algorithm.

  The "forest" it builds, is an ensemble of decision trees, usually trained with
  the “bagging” method.

  The general idea of the bagging method is that a combination of learning
  models increases the overall result. \

  **ExtremeRandomTrees**: Extreme Trees is an ensemble machine learning
  algorithm that combines the predictions from many decision trees. It is
  related to the widely used random forest algorithm. \

  **LightGBM**: LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree based
  learning algorithms. \

  **GradientBoosting**: The technique of transiting week learners into a strong
  learner is called Boosting. The gradient boosting algorithm process works on
  this theory of execution. \

  **XGBoostClassifier**: XGBoost: Extreme Gradient Boosting Algorithm. This
  algorithm is used for structured data where target column values can be
  divided into distinct class values.

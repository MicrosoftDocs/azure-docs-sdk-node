package: '@azure/core-lro'
summary: >+
  A class that represents the definition of a program that polls through
  consecutive requests

  until it reaches a state of completion.

  A poller can be executed manually, by polling request by request by calling to
  the `poll()` method repeatedly, until its operation is completed.

  It also provides a way to wait until the operation completes, by calling
  `pollUntilDone()` and waiting until the operation finishes.

  Pollers can also request the cancellation of the ongoing process to whom is
  providing the underlying long running operation.


  ```ts

  const poller = new MyPoller();


  // Polling just once:

  await poller.poll();


  // We can try to cancel the request here, by calling:

  //

  //     await poller.cancelOperation();

  //


  // Getting the final result:

  const result = await poller.pollUntilDone();

  ```


  The Poller is defined by two types, a type representing the state of the
  poller, which

  must include a basic set of properties from `PollOperationState<TResult>`,

  and a return type defined by `TResult`, which can be anything.


  The Poller class implements the `PollerLike` interface, which allows poller
  implementations to avoid having

  to export the Poller's class directly, and instead only export the already
  instantiated poller with the PollerLike type.


  ```ts

  class Client {
    public async makePoller: PollerLike<MyOperationState, MyResult> {
      const poller = new MyPoller({});
      // It might be preferred to return the poller after the first request is made,
      // so that some information can be obtained right away.
      await poller.poll();
      return poller;
    }
  }


  const poller: PollerLike<MyOperationState, MyResult> = myClient.makePoller();

  ```


  A poller can be created through its constructor, then it can be polled until
  it's completed.

  At any point in time, the state of the poller can be obtained without delay
  through the getOperationState method.

  At any point in time, the intermediate forms of the result type can be
  requested without delay.

  Once the underlying operation is marked as completed, the poller will stop and
  the final value will be returned.


  ```ts

  const poller = myClient.makePoller();

  const state: MyOperationState = poller.getOperationState();


  // The intermediate result can be obtained at any time.

  const result: MyResult | undefined = poller.getResult();


  // The final result can only be obtained after the poller finishes.

  const result: MyResult = await poller.pollUntilDone();

  ```

    summary: >
      A poller needs to be initialized by passing in at least the basic
      properties of the `PollOperation<TState, TResult>`.

      When writing an implementation of a Poller, this implementation needs to
      deal with the initialization

      of any custom state beyond the basic definition of the poller. The basic
      poller assumes that the poller's

      operation has already been defined, at least its basic properties. The
      code below shows how to approach

      the definition of the constructor of a new custom poller.


      ```ts

      export class MyPoller extends Poller<MyOperationState, string> {
        constructor({
          // Anything you might need outside of the basics
        }) {
          let state: MyOperationState = {
            privateProperty: private,
            publicProperty: public,
          };

          const operation = {
            state,
            update,
            cancel,
            toString
          }

          // Sending the operation to the parent's constructor.
          super(operation);

          // You can assign more local properties here.
        }
      }

      ```


      Inside of this constructor, a new promise is created. This will be used to

      tell the user when the poller finishes (see `pollUntilDone()`). The
      promise's

      resolve and reject methods are also used internally to control when to
      resolve

      or reject anyone waiting for the poller to finish.


      The constructor of a custom implementation of a poller is where any
      serialized version of

      a previous poller's operation should be deserialized into the operation
      sent to the

      base constructor. For example:


      ```ts

      export class MyPoller extends Poller<MyOperationState, string> {
        constructor(
          baseOperation: string | undefined
        ) {
          let state: MyOperationState = {};
          if (baseOperation) {
            state = {
              ...JSON.parse(baseOperation).state,
              ...state
            };
          }
          const operation = {
            state,
            // ...
          }
          super(operation);
        }
      }

      ```

      Returns the state of the operation.

      Even though TState will be the same type inside any of the methods of any
      extension of the Poller class,

      implementations of the pollers can customize what's shared with the public
      by writing their own

      version of the `getOperationState` method, and by defining two types, one
      representing the internal state of the poller

      and a public type representing a safe to share subset of the properties of
      the internal state.

      Their definition of getOperationState can then return their public type.


      Example:


      ```ts

      // Let's say we have our poller's operation state defined as:

      interface MyOperationState extends PollOperationState<ResultType> {
        privateProperty?: string;
        publicProperty?: string;
      }


      // To allow us to have a true separation of public and private state, we
      have to define another interface:

      interface PublicState extends PollOperationState<ResultType> {
        publicProperty?: string;
      }


      // Then, we define our Poller as follows:

      export class MyPoller extends Poller<MyOperationState, ResultType> {
        // ... More content is needed here ...

        public getOperationState(): PublicState {
          const state: PublicState = this.operation.state;
          return {
            // Properties from PollOperationState<TResult>
            isStarted: state.isStarted,
            isCompleted: state.isCompleted,
            isCancelled: state.isCancelled,
            error: state.error,
            result: state.result,

            // The only other property needed by PublicState.
            publicProperty: state.publicProperty
          }
        }
      }

      ```


      You can see this in the tests of this repository, go to the file:

      `../test/utils/testPoller.ts`

      and look for the getOperationState implementation.

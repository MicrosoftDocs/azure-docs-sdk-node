summary: >-
  Ranking function based on the Okapi BM25 similarity algorithm. BM25 is a
  TF-IDF-like algorithm that includes length normalization (controlled by the
  'b' parameter) as well as term frequency saturation (controlled by the 'k1'
  parameter).

      This property controls how the length of a document affects the relevance
      score. By default, a value of 0.75 is used. A value of 0.0 means no length
      normalization is applied, while a value of 1.0 means the score is fully
      normalized by the length of the document.

      This property controls the scaling function between the term frequency of
      each matching terms and the final relevance score of a document-query
      pair. By default, a value of 1.2 is used. A value of 0.0 means the score
      does not scale with an increase in term frequency.

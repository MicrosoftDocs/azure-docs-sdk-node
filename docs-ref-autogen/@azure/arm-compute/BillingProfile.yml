      Specifies the maximum price you are willing to pay for a Azure Spot
      VM/VMSS. This price is in

      US Dollars. <br><br> This price will be compared with the current Azure
      Spot price for the VM

      size. Also, the prices are compared at the time of create/update of Azure
      Spot VM/VMSS and the

      operation will only succeed if  the maxPrice is greater than the current
      Azure Spot price.

      <br><br> The maxPrice will also be used for evicting a Azure Spot VM/VMSS
      if the current Azure

      Spot price goes beyond the maxPrice after creation of VM/VMSS. <br><br>
      Possible values are:

      <br><br> - Any decimal value greater than zero. Example: 0.01538 <br><br>
      -1 – indicates

      default price to be up-to on-demand. <br><br> You can set the maxPrice to
      -1 to indicate that

      the Azure Spot VM/VMSS should not be evicted for price reasons. Also, the
      default max price is

      -1 if it is not provided by you. <br><br>Minimum api-version: 2019-03-01.

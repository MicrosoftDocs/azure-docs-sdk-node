      Command is the command line to execute inside the container, the working
      directory for the command is root ('/') in the container's filesystem. The
      command is not run inside a shell, so traditional shell instructions ('|',
      etc) won't work. To use a shell, you need to explicitly call out to that
      shell. Exit status of 0 is treated as live/healthy and non-zero is
      unhealthy.

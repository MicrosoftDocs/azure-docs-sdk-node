  CORS is an HTTP feature that enables a web application running under one
  domain to access resources in another domain. Web browsers implement a
  security restriction known as same-origin policy that prevents a web page from
  calling APIs in a different domain; CORS provides a secure way to allow one
  domain (the origin domain) to call APIs in another domain.

      Asynchronously copies a blob to a destination within the storage account.

      This method returns a long running operation poller that allows you to

      indefinitely until the copy is completed.

      You can also cancel a copy before it is completed by calling
      `cancelOperation` on the poller.

      Note that the onProgress callback will not be invoked if the operation
      completes in the first

      request, and attempting to cancel a completed copy will result in an error
      being thrown.

      In version 2012-02-12 and later, the source for a Copy Blob operation can
      be

      a committed blob in any Azure storage account.

      Beginning with version 2015-02-21, the source for a Copy Blob operation
      can be

      an Azure file in any Azure storage account.

      Only storage accounts created on or after June 7th, 2012 allow the Copy
      Blob

      operation to copy from another storage account.

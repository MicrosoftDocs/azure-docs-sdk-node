            disable - Disable the job. This is equivalent to calling the disable
            job

            API, with a disableTasks value of requeue.

            The default is 'satisfy' for exit code 0, and 'block' for all other

            conditions. If the job's usesTaskDependencies property is set to
            false, then

            The default is 'satisfy' for exit code 0, and 'block' for all other

            conditions. If the job's usesTaskDependencies property is set to

            task

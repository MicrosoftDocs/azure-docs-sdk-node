  Specifies the processing type used for serving the request.

  - If set to 'auto', then the request will be processed with the service tier
  configured in the Project settings. Unless otherwise configured, the Project
  will use 'default'.

  - If set to 'default', then the request will be processed with the standard
  pricing and performance for the selected model.

  - If set to '[flex](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/flex-processing)'
  or '[priority](https://openai.com/api-priority-processing/)', then the request
  will be processed with the corresponding service tier.

  - When not set, the default behavior is 'auto'.

  When the `service_tier` parameter is set, the response body will include the
  `service_tier` value based on the processing mode actually used to serve the
  request. This response value may be different from the value set in the
  parameter.

  Describes the options that can be provided while creating the EventHubClient.

  - `userAgent`        : A string to append to the built in user agent string
  that is passed as a connection property

  to the service.

  - `webSocketOptions` : Options to configure the channelling of the AMQP
  connection over Web Sockets.
     - `websocket`     : The WebSocket constructor used to create an AMQP connection if you choose to make the connection
  over a WebSocket.
     - `webSocketConstructorOptions` : Options to pass to the Websocket constructor when you choose to make the connection
  over a WebSocket.

  - `retryOptions`     : The retry options for all the operations on the
  client/producer/consumer.
     - `maxRetries` : The number of times the operation can be retried in case of a retryable error.
     - `maxRetryDelayInMs`: The maximum delay between retries. Applicable only when performing exponential retries.
     - `mode`: Which retry mode to apply, specified by the `RetryMode` enum. Options are `Exponential` and `Fixed`. Defaults to `Fixed`.
     - `retryDelayInMs`: Amount of time to wait in milliseconds before making the next attempt. When `mode` is set to `Exponential`,
        this is used to compute the exponentially increasing delays between retries. Default: 30000 milliseconds.
     - `timeoutInMs`: Amount of time in milliseconds to wait before the operation times out. This will trigger a retry if there are any
        retry attempts remaining. Default value: 60000 milliseconds.

  A simple usage can be `{ "maxRetries": 4 }`.


  Example usage:

  ```ts snippet:ignore

  {
      retryOptions: {
          maxRetries: 4
      }
  }

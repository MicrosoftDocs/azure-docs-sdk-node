      AKS will update the nodes with a newly patched VHD containing security
      fixes and bugfixes on a weekly cadence. With the VHD update machines will
      be rolling reimaged to that VHD following maintenance windows and surge
      settings. No extra VHD cost is incurred when choosing this option as AKS
      hosts the images.

      No attempt to update your machines OS will be made either by OS or by
      rolling VHDs. This means you are responsible for your security updates

    package: '@azure/arm-containerservice'
    summary: >-
      AKS downloads and updates the nodes with tested security updates. These
      updates honor the maintenance window settings and produce a new VHD that
      is used on new nodes. On some occasions it's not possible to apply the
      updates in place, in such cases the existing nodes will also be re-imaged
      to the newly produced VHD in order to apply the changes. This option
      incurs an extra cost of hosting the new Security Patch VHDs in your
      resource group for just in time consumption.

      OS updates will be applied automatically through the OS built-in patching
      infrastructure. Newly scaled in machines will be unpatched initially and
      will be patched at some point by the OS's infrastructure. Behavior of this
      option depends on the OS in question. Ubuntu and Mariner apply security
      patches through unattended upgrade roughly once a day around 06:00 UTC.
      Windows does not apply security patches automatically and so for them this
      option is equivalent to None till further notice

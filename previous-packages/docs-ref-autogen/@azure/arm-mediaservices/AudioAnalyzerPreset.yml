      The language for the audio payload in the input using the BCP-47 format of
      'language tag-region' (e.g: 'en-US').  If you know the language of your
      content, it is recommended that you specify it. The language must be
      specified explicitly for AudioAnalysisMode::Basic, since automatic
      language detection is not included in basic mode. If the language isn't
      specified or set to null, automatic language detection will choose the
      first language detected and process with the selected language for the
      duration of the file. It does not currently support dynamically switching
      between languages after the first language is detected. The automatic
      detection works best with audio recordings with clearly discernable
      speech. If automatic detection fails to find the language, transcription
      would fallback to 'en-US'." The list of supported languages is available
      here: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109463

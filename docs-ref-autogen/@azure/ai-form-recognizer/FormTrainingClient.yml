      This method returns a long running operation poller that allows you to

      indefinitely until the operation is completed.

      Note that the onProgress callback will not be invoked if the operation
      completes in the first

      being thrown.

      to use during form recognition.


      This method returns a long-running operation poller that allows you to

      If the `useTrainingLabels` parameter is set to `true`, then the operation
      will search

      for label files in addition to the training documents, and it will create
      a labeled

      model with the field names specified by the labels. Otherwise, it will

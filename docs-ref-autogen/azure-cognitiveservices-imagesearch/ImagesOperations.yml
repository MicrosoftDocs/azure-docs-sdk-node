            - string
          description: "Bing uses this header to provide users\rwith consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new\rfeatures and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning\rtraffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a\ruser across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user to multiple\rconflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead\rto an inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second request has a\rdifferent flight assignment than the first, the experience may be\runexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that\rclient ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing\ralso uses this header to help improve result rankings by analyzing the\ractivity generated by a client ID. The relevance improvements help with\rbetter quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher\rclick-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you\rshould consider this header required. Persisting the client ID across\rmultiple requests for the same end user and device combination enables 1)\rthe API consumer to receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher\rclick-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each\ruser that uses your application on the device must have a unique, Bing\rgenerated client ID. If you do not include this header in the request, Bing\rgenerates an ID and returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The\ronly time that you should NOT include this header in a request is the first\rtime the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing\rAPI request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the\rclient ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie\rto ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie.\rFor other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to\rpersist the ID. The next time the user uses your app on that device, get the\rclient ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this\rheader. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use\rit for all subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If you\rinclude the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request."

Although\roptional, you are encouraged to always specify this header and the\rX-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for example, by\rchanging the last octet to 0).

Negative values indicate western longitudes and\rpositive values indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The radius, in\rmeters, which specifies the horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the\rvalue returned by the device's location service. Typical values might be 22m\rfor GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP\rlookup. ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the\rlocation. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1,\r1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading or direction of\rtravel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360,\rcounting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp\rkey is nonzero. sp (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters\rper second, that the client device is traveling. alt (optional): The\raltitude of the client device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in\rmeters, that specifies the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify\rthis key only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are\roptional, the more information that you provide, the more accurate the\rlocation results are. Although optional, you are encouraged to always\rspecify the user's geographical location. Providing the location is\respecially important if the client's IP address does not accurately reflect\rthe user's physical location (for example, if the client uses VPN).

          description: "Bing uses this header to provide users\rwith consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new\rfeatures and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning\rtraffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a\ruser across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user to multiple\rconflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead\rto an inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second request has a\rdifferent flight assignment than the first, the experience may be\runexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that\rclient ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing\ralso uses this header to help improve result rankings by analyzing the\ractivity generated by a client ID. The relevance improvements help with\rbetter quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher\rclick-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you\rshould consider this header required. Persisting the client ID across\rmultiple requests for the same end user and device combination enables 1)\rthe API consumer to receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher\rclick-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each\ruser that uses your application on the device must have a unique, Bing\rgenerated client ID. If you do not include this header in the request, Bing\rgenerates an ID and returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The\ronly time that you should NOT include this header in a request is the first\rtime the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing\rAPI request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the\rclient ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie\rto ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie.\rFor other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to\rpersist the ID. The next time the user uses your app on that device, get the\rclient ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this\rheader. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use\rit for all subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If you\rinclude the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request."

          description: "Bing uses this header to provide users\rwith consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new\rfeatures and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning\rtraffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a\ruser across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user to multiple\rconflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead\rto an inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second request has a\rdifferent flight assignment than the first, the experience may be\runexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that\rclient ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing\ralso uses this header to help improve result rankings by analyzing the\ractivity generated by a client ID. The relevance improvements help with\rbetter quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher\rclick-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you\rshould consider this header required. Persisting the client ID across\rmultiple requests for the same end user and device combination enables 1)\rthe API consumer to receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher\rclick-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each\ruser that uses your application on the device must have a unique, Bing\rgenerated client ID. If you do not include this header in the request, Bing\rgenerates an ID and returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The\ronly time that you should NOT include this header in a request is the first\rtime the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing\rAPI request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the\rclient ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie\rto ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie.\rFor other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to\rpersist the ID. The next time the user uses your app on that device, get the\rclient ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this\rheader. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use\rit for all subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device.

          description: "Bing uses this header to provide users\rwith consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new\rfeatures and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning\rtraffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a\ruser across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user to multiple\rconflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead\rto an inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second request has a\rdifferent flight assignment than the first, the experience may be\runexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that\rclient ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing\ralso uses this header to help improve result rankings by analyzing the\ractivity generated by a client ID. The relevance improvements help with\rbetter quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher\rclick-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you\rshould consider this header required. Persisting the client ID across\rmultiple requests for the same end user and device combination enables 1)\rthe API consumer to receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher\rclick-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each\ruser that uses your application on the device must have a unique, Bing\rgenerated client ID. If you do not include this header in the request, Bing\rgenerates an ID and returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The\ronly time that you should NOT include this header in a request is the first\rtime the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing\rAPI request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the\rclient ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie\rto ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie.\rFor other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to\rpersist the ID. The next time the user uses your app on that device, get the\rclient ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this\rheader. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use\rit for all subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device.

If you specify a market that is not listed in [Market\rCodes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes),\rBing uses a best fit market code based on an internal mapping that is\rsubject to change. This parameter and the\r[cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#cc)\rquery parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both."

          description: "Filter images for adult content. The\rfollowing are the possible filter values. Off: May return images with adult\rcontent. If the request is through the Image Search API, the response\rincludes thumbnail images that are clear (non-fuzzy). However, if the\rrequest is through the Web Search API, the response includes thumbnail\rimages that are pixelated (fuzzy). Moderate: If the request is through the\rImage Search API, the response doesn't include images with adult content. If\rthe request is through the Web Search API, the response may include images\rwith adult content (the thumbnail images are pixelated (fuzzy)). Strict: Do\rnot return images with adult content. The default is Moderate. If the\rrequest comes from a market that Bing's adult policy requires that\rsafeSearch is set to Strict, Bing ignores the safeSearch value and uses\rStrict. If you use the site: query operator, there is the chance that the\rresponse may contain adult content regardless of what the safeSearch query\rparameter is set to. Use site: only if you are aware of the content on the\rsite and your scenario supports the possibility of adult content. Possible\rvalues include: 'Off', 'Moderate', 'Strict'"

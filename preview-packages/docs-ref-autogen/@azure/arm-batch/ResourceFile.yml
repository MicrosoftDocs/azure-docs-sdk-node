      The property is valid only when autoStorageContainerName or
      storageContainerUrl is used. This prefix can be a partial filename or a
      subdirectory. If a prefix is not specified, all the files in the container
      will be downloaded.

      This property applies only to files being downloaded to Linux compute
      nodes. It will be ignored if it is specified for a resourceFile which will
      be downloaded to a Windows node. If this property is not specified for a
      Linux node, then a default value of 0770 is applied to the file.

    summary: >-
      If the httpUrl property is specified, the filePath is required and
      describes the path which the file will be downloaded to, including the
      filename. Otherwise, if the autoStorageContainerName or
      storageContainerUrl property is specified, filePath is optional and is the
      directory to download the files to. In the case where filePath is used as
      a directory, any directory structure already associated with the input
      data will be retained in full and appended to the specified filePath
      directory. The specified relative path cannot break out of the task's
      working directory (for example by using '..').

      The autoStorageContainerName, storageContainerUrl and httpUrl properties
      are mutually exclusive and one of them must be specified. If the URL
      points to Azure Blob Storage, it must be readable from compute nodes.
      There are three ways to get such a URL for a blob in Azure storage:
      include a Shared Access Signature (SAS) granting read permissions on the
      blob, use a managed identity with read permission, or set the ACL for the
      blob or its container to allow public access.

      The autoStorageContainerName, storageContainerUrl and httpUrl properties

      (SAS) granting read and list permissions on the container, use a managed

      Allows filtering of the application health state objects returned in the
      result of cluster

      health

      query based on their health state.

      The possible values for this parameter include integer value obtained from
      members or bitwise

      operations

      on members of HealthStateFilter enumeration. Only applications that match
      the filter are

      returned.

      All applications are used to evaluate the aggregated health state. If not
      specified, all

      entries are returned.

      The state values are flag-based enumeration, so the value could be a
      combination of these

      values obtained using bitwise 'OR' operator.

      For example, if the provided value is 6 then health state of applications
      with HealthState

      value of OK (2) and Warning (4) are returned.


      - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.

      - None - Filter that doesn't match any HealthState value. Used in order to
      return no results

      on a given collection of states. The value is 1.

      - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is
      2.

      - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The
      value is 4.

      - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The
      value is 8.

      - All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is
      65535. Default

      value: 0.

      If not present, the health evaluation uses the cluster health policy

      By default, each application is evaluated using its specific application
      health policy,

      defined in the application manifest, or the default health policy, if no
      policy is defined in

      manifest.

      If the application health policy map is specified, and it has an entry for
      an application, the

      specified application health policy

      is used to evaluate the application health.

  **PlannedFailover**: Triggers a failover from primary to standby without
  killing the primary database process first. This is a graceful failover that
  attempts to preserve data consistency. \

  the failover. This is more aggressive and used when the primary is
  unresponsive or in an unhealthy state. \

  operation where roles are swapped between primary and standby. \

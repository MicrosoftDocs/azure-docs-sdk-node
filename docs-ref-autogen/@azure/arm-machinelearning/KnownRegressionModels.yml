    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'
    summary: >-
      Decision Trees are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for
      both classification and regression tasks.

      The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable
      by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.
  - name: ElasticNet
    uid: '@azure/arm-machinelearning.KnownRegressionModels.ElasticNet'
    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'
    summary: >-
      Elastic net is a popular type of regularized linear regression that
      combines two popular penalties, specifically the L1 and L2 penalty
      functions.
  - name: ExtremeRandomTrees
    uid: '@azure/arm-machinelearning.KnownRegressionModels.ExtremeRandomTrees'
    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'
    summary: >-
      Extreme Trees is an ensemble machine learning algorithm that combines the
      predictions from many decision trees. It is related to the widely used
      random forest algorithm.
  - name: GradientBoosting
    uid: '@azure/arm-machinelearning.KnownRegressionModels.GradientBoosting'
    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'
    summary: >-
      The technique of transiting week learners into a strong learner is called
      Boosting. The gradient boosting algorithm process works on this theory of
      execution.
  - name: KNN
    uid: '@azure/arm-machinelearning.KnownRegressionModels.KNN'
    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'
    summary: >-
      K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm uses 'feature similarity' to predict
      the values of new datapoints

      which further means that the new data point will be assigned a value based
      on how closely it matches the points in the training set.
  - name: LassoLars
    uid: '@azure/arm-machinelearning.KnownRegressionModels.LassoLars'
    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'
    summary: >-
      Lasso model fit with Least Angle Regression a.k.a. Lars. It is a Linear
      Model trained with an L1 prior as regularizer.
  - name: LightGBM
    uid: '@azure/arm-machinelearning.KnownRegressionModels.LightGBM'
    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'
    summary: >-
      LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree based learning
      algorithms.
  - name: RandomForest
    uid: '@azure/arm-machinelearning.KnownRegressionModels.RandomForest'
    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'
    summary: >-
      Random forest is a supervised learning algorithm.

      The "forest" it builds, is an ensemble of decision trees, usually trained
      with the “bagging” method.

      The general idea of the bagging method is that a combination of learning
      models increases the overall result.
  - name: SGD
    uid: '@azure/arm-machinelearning.KnownRegressionModels.SGD'
    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'
    summary: >-
      SGD: Stochastic gradient descent is an optimization algorithm often used
      in machine learning applications

      to find the model parameters that correspond to the best fit between
      predicted and actual outputs.

      It's an inexact but powerful technique.
  - name: XGBoostRegressor
    uid: '@azure/arm-machinelearning.KnownRegressionModels.XGBoostRegressor'
    package: '@azure/arm-machinelearning'
    summary: >-
      XGBoostRegressor: Extreme Gradient Boosting Regressor is a supervised
      machine learning model using ensemble of base learners.

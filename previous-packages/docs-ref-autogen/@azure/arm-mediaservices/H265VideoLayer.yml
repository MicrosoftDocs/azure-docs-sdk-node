      The average bitrate in bits per second at which to encode the input video
      when generating this layer. For example: a target bitrate of 3000Kbps or
      3Mbps means this value should be 3000000 This is a required field.

      The frame rate (in frames per second) at which to encode this layer. The
      value can be in the form of M/N where M and N are integers (For example,
      30000/1001), or in the form of a number (For example, 30, or 29.97). The
      encoder enforces constraints on allowed frame rates based on the profile
      and level. If it is not specified, the encoder will use the same frame
      rate as the input video.

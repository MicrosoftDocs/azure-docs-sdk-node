      If auto pool creation fails, the Batch service moves the job to a
      completed

      state, and the pool creation error is set in the job's scheduling error
      property. The Batch

      service manages the lifetime (both creation and, unless keepAlive is
      specified, deletion) of

      the auto pool. Any user actions that affect the lifetime of the auto pool
      while the job is

      active will result in unexpected behavior. You must specify either the
      pool ID or the auto

      pool specification, but not both.

      You must ensure that the pool referenced by this property exists. If the
      pool

      does not exist at the time the Batch service tries to schedule a job, no
      tasks for the job

      will run until you create a pool with that id. Note that the Batch service
      will not reject the

      job request; it will simply not run tasks until the pool exists. You must
      specify either the

      pool ID or the auto pool specification, but not both.

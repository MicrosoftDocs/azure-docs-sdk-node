      The interval, in seconds, for how frequently to probe the endpoint for
      health status. Typically, the interval is slightly less than half the
      allocated timeout period (in seconds) which allows two full probes before
      taking the instance out of rotation. The default value is 15, the minimum
      value is 5.

      The number of probes where if no response, will result in stopping further
      traffic from being delivered to the endpoint. This values allows endpoints
      to be taken out of rotation faster or slower than the typical times used
      in Azure.

      The number of consecutive successful or failed probes in order to allow or
      deny traffic from being delivered to this endpoint. After failing the
      number of consecutive probes equal to this value, the endpoint will be
      taken out of rotation and require the same number of successful
      consecutive probes to be placed back in rotation.

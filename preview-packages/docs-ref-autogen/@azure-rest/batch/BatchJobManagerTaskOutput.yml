summary: >-
  Specifies details of a Job Manager Task.

  The Job Manager Task is automatically started when the Job is created. The

  Batch service tries to schedule the Job Manager Task before any other Tasks in

  the Job. When shrinking a Pool, the Batch service tries to preserve Nodes
  where

  Job Manager Tasks are running for as long as possible (that is, Compute Nodes

  running 'normal' Tasks are removed before Compute Nodes running Job Manager

  Tasks). When a Job Manager Task fails and needs to be restarted, the system

  tries to schedule it at the highest priority. If there are no idle Compute

  Nodes available, the system may terminate one of the running Tasks in the Pool

  and return it to the queue in order to make room for the Job Manager Task to

  restart. Note that a Job Manager Task in one Job does not have priority over

  Tasks in other Jobs. Across Jobs, only Job level priorities are observed. For

  example, if a Job Manager in a priority 0 Job needs to be restarted, it will

  not displace Tasks of a priority 1 Job. Batch will retry Tasks when a recovery

  operation is triggered on a Node. Examples of recovery operations include (but

  are not limited to) when an unhealthy Node is rebooted or a Compute Node

  disappeared due to host failure. Retries due to recovery operations are

  independent of and are not counted against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the

  maxTaskRetryCount is 0, an internal retry due to a recovery operation may

  occur. Because of this, all Tasks should be idempotent. This means Tasks need

  to tolerate being interrupted and restarted without causing any corruption or

  duplicate data. The best practice for long running Tasks is to use some form
  of

  checkpointing.

      The settings for an authentication token that the Task can use to perform
      Batch service operations. If this property is set, the Batch service

      authenticate Batch service operations without requiring an Account access
      key. The token is provided via the AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN
      environment variable. The operations that the Task can carry out using the
      token depend on the settings. For example, a Task can request Job
      permissions in order to add other Tasks to the Job, or check the status of
      the Job or of other Tasks under the Job.

      Whether completion of the Job Manager Task signifies completion of the
      entire Job. If true, when the Job Manager Task completes, the Batch
      service marks the Job as complete. If any Tasks are still running at this
      time (other than Job Release), those Tasks are terminated. If false, the
      completion of the Job Manager Task does not affect the Job status. In this
      case, you should either use the onAllTasksComplete attribute to terminate
      the Job, or have a client or user terminate the Job explicitly. An example
      of this is if the Job Manager creates a set of Tasks but then takes no
      further role in their execution. The default value is true. If you are
      using the onAllTasksComplete and onTaskFailure attributes to control Job
      lifetime, and using the Job Manager Task only to create the Tasks for the
      Job (not to monitor progress), then it is important to set
      killJobOnCompletion to false.

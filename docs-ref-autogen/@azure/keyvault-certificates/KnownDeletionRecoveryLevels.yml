      @azure/keyvault-certificates.KnownDeletionRecoveryLevels.CustomizedRecoverable
    package: '@azure/keyvault-certificates'
    summary: >-
      Denotes a vault state in which deletion is recoverable without the
      possibility for immediate and permanent deletion (i.e. purge when 7 <=
      SoftDeleteRetentionInDays < 90).This level guarantees the recoverability
      of the deleted entity during the retention interval and while the
      subscription is still available.

    uid: >-
      @azure/keyvault-certificates.KnownDeletionRecoveryLevels.CustomizedRecoverableProtectedSubscription
    package: '@azure/keyvault-certificates'
    summary: >-
      Denotes a vault and subscription state in which deletion is recoverable,
      immediate and permanent deletion (i.e. purge) is not permitted, and in
      which the subscription itself cannot be permanently canceled when 7 <=
      SoftDeleteRetentionInDays < 90. This level guarantees the recoverability
      of the deleted entity during the retention interval, and also reflects the
      fact that the subscription itself cannot be cancelled.

      Denotes a vault state in which deletion is recoverable, and which also
      permits immediate and permanent deletion (i.e. purge when 7 <=
      SoftDeleteRetentionInDays < 90). This level guarantees the recoverability
      of the deleted entity during the retention interval, unless a Purge
      operation is requested, or the subscription is cancelled.
  - name: Purgeable
    uid: '@azure/keyvault-certificates.KnownDeletionRecoveryLevels.Purgeable'
    package: '@azure/keyvault-certificates'
    summary: >-
      Denotes a vault state in which deletion is an irreversible operation,
      without the possibility for recovery. This level corresponds to no
      protection being available against a Delete operation; the data is
      irretrievably lost upon accepting a Delete operation at the entity level
      or higher (vault, resource group, subscription etc.)
  - name: Recoverable

    package: '@azure/keyvault-certificates'
    summary: >-
      Denotes a vault state in which deletion is recoverable without the
      possibility for immediate and permanent deletion (i.e. purge). This level
      guarantees the recoverability of the deleted entity during the retention
      interval (90 days) and while the subscription is still available. System
      wil permanently delete it after 90 days, if not recovered

  The Video Analyzer edge module can act as a transparent gateway for video,
  enabling IoT devices to send video to the cloud from behind a firewall. A
  remote device adapter should be created for each such IoT device.
  Communication between the cloud and IoT device would then flow via the Video
  Analyzer edge module.

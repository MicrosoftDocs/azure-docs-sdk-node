      The value of CRF to be used when encoding this layer. This setting takes
      effect when RateControlMode of video codec is set at CRF mode. The range
      of CRF value is between 0 and 51, where lower values would result in
      better quality, at the expense of higher file sizes. Higher values mean
      more compression, but at some point quality degradation will be noticed.
      Default value is 23.

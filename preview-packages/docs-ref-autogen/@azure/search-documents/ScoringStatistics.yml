summary: >-
  A value that specifies whether we want to calculate scoring statistics (such
  as document frequency) globally for more consistent scoring, or locally, for
  lower latency. The default is 'local'. Use 'global' to aggregate scoring
  statistics globally before scoring. Using global scoring statistics can
  increase latency of search queries.

  ### Known values supported by the service

  **Invalid**: An invalid correlation scheme. Cannot be used. The value is zero.
  \

  **Affinity**: Indicates that this service has an affinity relationship with
  another service. Provided for backwards compatibility, consider preferring the
  Aligned or NonAlignedAffinity options. The value is 1. \

  **AlignedAffinity**: Aligned affinity ensures that the primaries of the
  partitions of the affinitized services are collocated on the same nodes. This
  is the default and is the same as selecting the Affinity scheme. The value is
  2. \

  **NonAlignedAffinity**: Non-Aligned affinity guarantees that all replicas of
  each service will be placed on the same nodes. Unlike Aligned Affinity, this
  does not guarantee that replicas of particular role will be collocated. The
  value is 3.

      Allow VMSS to ignore AZ boundaries when constructing upgrade batches. Take
      into consideration the Update Domain and maxBatchInstancePercent to
      determine the batch size. If this field is not set, Azure Azure Batch will
      not set its default value. The value of enableCrossZoneUpgrade on the
      created VirtualMachineScaleSet will be decided by the default
      configurations on VirtualMachineScaleSet. This field is able to be set to
      true or false only when using NodePlacementConfiguration as Zonal.

      The maximum percent of total virtual machine instances that will be
      upgraded simultaneously by the rolling upgrade in one batch. As this is a
      maximum, unhealthy instances in previous or future batches can cause the
      percentage of instances in a batch to decrease to ensure higher
      reliability. The value of this field should be between 5 and 100,
      inclusive. If both maxBatchInstancePercent and maxUnhealthyInstancePercent
      are assigned with value, the value of maxBatchInstancePercent should not
      be more than maxUnhealthyInstancePercent.

      The maximum percentage of the total virtual machine instances in the scale
      set that can be simultaneously unhealthy, either as a result of being
      upgraded, or by being found in an unhealthy state by the virtual machine
      health checks before the rolling upgrade aborts. This constraint will be
      checked prior to starting any batch. The value of this field should be
      between 5 and 100, inclusive. If both maxBatchInstancePercent and
      maxUnhealthyInstancePercent are assigned with value, the value of
      maxBatchInstancePercent should not be more than
      maxUnhealthyInstancePercent.

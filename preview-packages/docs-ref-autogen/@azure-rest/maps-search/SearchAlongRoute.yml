      The Search Along Route endpoint allows you to perform a fuzzy search for
      POIs along a specified route. This search is constrained by specifying the
      `maxDetourTime` limiting measure.<br><br>To send the route-points you will
      use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the `route`
      object represented as a `GeoJSON LineString` type and the `Content-Type`
      header will be set to `application/json`. Each route-point in `route` is
      represented as a `GeoJSON Position` type i.e. an array where the
      _longitude_ value is followed by the _latitude_ value and the _altitude_
      value is ignored. The `route` should contain at least 2
      route-points.<br><br>It is possible that original route will be altered,
      some of it's points may be skipped. If the route that passes through the
      found point is faster than the original one, the `detourTime` value in the
      response is negative.

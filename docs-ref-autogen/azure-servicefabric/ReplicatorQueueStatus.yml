      Provides various statistics of the queue used in the service fabric
      replicator.

      Contains information about the service fabric replicator like the
      replication/copy queue

      utilization, last acknowledgement received timestamp, etc.

      Depending on the role of the replicator, the properties in this type imply
      different meanings.

      On a primary replicator, this is semantically the highest sequence number
      of the operation for

      acknowledgement.

      On a secondary replicator, this is semantically the highest sequence
      number of the in-order

      operation received from the primary.

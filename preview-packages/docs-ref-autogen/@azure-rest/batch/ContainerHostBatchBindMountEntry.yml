      Mount this source path as read-only mode or not. Default value is false
      (read/write mode). For Linux, if you mount this path as a read/write mode,
      this does not mean that all users in container have the read/write access
      for the path, it depends on the access in host VM. If this path is mounted
      read-only, all users within the container will not be able to modify the
      path.

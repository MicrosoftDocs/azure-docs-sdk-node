      Each node gets allocated with a non-contiguous list of IP addresses
      assignable to pods. This is better for maximizing a small to medium subnet
      of size /16 or smaller. The Azure CNI cluster with dynamic IP allocation
      defaults to this mode if the customer does not explicitly specify a
      podIPAllocationMode

    uid: '@azure/arm-containerservice.KnownPodIPAllocationMode.StaticBlock'
    package: '@azure/arm-containerservice'
    summary: >-
      Each node is statically allocated CIDR block(s) of size /28 = 16 IPs per
      block to satisfy the maxPods per node. Number of CIDR blocks >= (maxPods /
      16). The block, rather than a single IP, counts against the Azure Vnet
      Private IP limit of 65K. Therefore block mode is suitable for running
      larger workloads with more than the current limit of 65K pods in a
      cluster. This mode is better suited to scale with larger subnets of /15 or
      bigger

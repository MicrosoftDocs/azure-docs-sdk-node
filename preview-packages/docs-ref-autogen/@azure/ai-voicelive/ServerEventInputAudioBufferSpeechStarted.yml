### YamlMime:TSType
name: ServerEventInputAudioBufferSpeechStarted
uid: '@azure/ai-voicelive.ServerEventInputAudioBufferSpeechStarted'
package: '@azure/ai-voicelive'
summary: >-
  Sent by the server when in `server_vad` mode to indicate that speech has been

  detected in the audio buffer. This can happen any time audio is added to the

  buffer (unless speech is already detected). The client may want to use this

  event to interrupt audio playback or provide visual feedback to the user.

  The client should expect to receive a `input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped`
  event

  when speech stops. The `item_id` property is the ID of the user message item

  that will be created when speech stops and will also be included in the

  `input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped` event (unless the client manually commits

  the audio buffer during VAD activation).

      Milliseconds from the start of all audio written to the buffer during the
      session when speech was first detected. This will correspond to the
      beginning of audio sent to the model, and thus includes the
      `prefix_padding_ms` configured in the Session.

    uid: '@azure/search-documents.BaseVectorSearchCompression.truncationDimension'
    package: '@azure/search-documents'
    summary: >-
      The number of dimensions to truncate the vectors to. Truncating the
      vectors reduces the size of the vectors and the amount of data that needs
      to be transferred during search. This can save storage cost and improve
      search performance at the expense of recall. It should be only used for
      embeddings trained with Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) such as
      OpenAI text-embedding-3-large (small). The default value is null, which
      means no truncation.

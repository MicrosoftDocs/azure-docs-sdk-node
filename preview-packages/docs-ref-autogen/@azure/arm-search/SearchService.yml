    package: '@azure/arm-search'
    summary: >-
      The state of the last provisioning operation performed on the search
      service. Provisioning is an intermediate state that occurs while service
      capacity is being established. After capacity is set up, provisioningState
      changes to either 'succeeded' or 'failed'. Client applications can poll
      provisioning status (the recommended polling interval is from 30 seconds
      to one minute) by using the Get Search Service operation to see when an
      operation is completed. If you are using the free service, this value
      tends to come back as 'succeeded' directly in the call to Create search
      service. This is because the free service uses capacity that is already
      set up.

      the server.

      The status of the search service. Possible values include: 'running': The
      search service is running and no provisioning operations are underway.
      'provisioning': The search service is being provisioned or scaled up or
      down. 'deleting': The search service is being deleted. 'degraded': The
      search service is degraded. This can occur when the underlying search
      units are not healthy. The search service is most likely operational, but
      performance might be slow and some requests might be dropped. 'disabled':
      The search service is disabled. In this state, the service will reject all
      API requests. 'error': The search service is in an error state. 'stopped':
      The search service is in a subscription that's disabled. If your service
      is in the degraded, disabled, or error states, it means the Azure AI
      Search team is actively investigating the underlying issue. Dedicated
      services in these states are still chargeable based on the number of
      search units provisioned.

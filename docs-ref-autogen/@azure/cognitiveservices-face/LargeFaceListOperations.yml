      different face lists are in parallel.

      * The minimum detectable face size is 36x36 pixels in an image no larger
      than 1920x1080 pixels.

      Images with dimensions higher than 1920x1080 pixels will need a

      Create an empty large face list with user-specified largeFaceListId, name,

      <br /> Large face list is a list of faces, up to 1,000,000 faces, and used
      by [Face - Find

      Similar](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/face/face/findsimilar).

      <br /> After creation, user should use [LargeFaceList Face -

      Add](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/face/largefacelist/addfacefromurl)
      to

      import the faces and [LargeFaceList -

      Train](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/face/largefacelist/train)
      to make

      it ready for [Face - Find

      Similar](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/face/face/findsimilar).
      No image

      will be stored. Only the extracted face features are stored on server
      until [LargeFaceList -

      Delete](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/face/largefacelist/delete)
      is

      called.

      <br /> Find Similar is used for scenario like finding celebrity-like
      faces, similar face

      filtering, or as a light way face identification. But if the actual use is
      to identify person,

      please use
      [PersonGroup](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/face/persongroup)

      /

      [LargePersonGroup](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/face/largepersongroup)

      and [Face -
      Identify](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/face/face/identify).

      <br/>'recognitionModel' should be specified to associate with this large
      face list. The default

      value for 'recognitionModel' is 'recognition_01', if the latest model
      needed, please explicitly

      specify the model you need in this parameter. New faces that are added to
      an existing large face

      list will use the recognition model that's already associated with the
      collection. Existing face

      features in a large face list can't be updated to features extracted by
      another version of

      recognition model.

      * 'recognition_01': The default recognition model for [LargeFaceList-

      Create](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/face/largefacelist/create).
      All

      those large face lists created before 2019 March are bonded with this
      recognition model.

      * 'recognition_02': Recognition model released in 2019 March.

      * 'recognition_03': Recognition model released in 2020 May.
      'recognition_03' is recommended

      since its overall accuracy is improved compared with 'recognition_01' and
      'recognition_02'.

      Large face list quota:

      * Free-tier subscription quota: 64 large face lists.

      To get face information inside largeFaceList use [LargeFaceList Face -

      Get](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/face/largefacelist/getface)<br
      />

      * Large face lists are stored in alphabetical order of largeFaceListId.

      * "start" parameter (string, optional) is a user-provided largeFaceListId
      value that returned

      entries have larger ids by string comparison. "start" set to empty to
      indicate return from the

      first item.

      * "top" parameter (int, optional) specifies the number of entries to
      return. A maximal of 1000

      entries can be returned in one call. To fetch more, you can specify
      "start" with the last

      returned entry’s Id of the current call.

      <br />

      For example, total 5 large person lists: "list1", ..., "list5".

      <br /> "start=&top=" will return all 5 lists.

      <br /> "start=&top=2" will return "list1", "list2".

      <br /> "start=list2&top=3" will return "list3", "list4", "list5".

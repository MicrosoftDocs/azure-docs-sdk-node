      The scope for the auto user. The default value is pool. If the pool is
      running Windows a value of Task should be specified if stricter isolation
      between tasks is required. For example, if the task mutates the registry
      in a way which could impact other tasks, or if certificates have been
      specified on the pool which should not be accessible by normal tasks but
      should be accessible by StartTasks.

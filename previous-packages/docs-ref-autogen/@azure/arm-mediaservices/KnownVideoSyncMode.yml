      This is the default method. Chooses between Cfr and Vfr depending on muxer
      capabilities. For output format MP4, the default mode is Cfr.

    summary: >-
      Input frames will be repeated and/or dropped as needed to achieve exactly
      the requested constant frame rate. Recommended when the output frame rate
      is explicitly set at a specified value

    summary: >-
      The presentation timestamps on frames are passed through from the input
      file to the output file writer. Recommended when the input source has
      variable frame rate, and are attempting to produce multiple layers for
      adaptive streaming in the output which have aligned GOP boundaries. Note:
      if two or more frames in the input have duplicate timestamps, then the
      output will also have the same behavior

    summary: >-
      Similar to the Passthrough mode, but if the input has frames that have
      duplicate timestamps, then only one frame is passed through to the output,
      and others are dropped. Recommended when the number of output frames is
      expected to be equal to the number of input frames. For example, the
      output is used to calculate a quality metric like PSNR against the input

summary: >-
  Object tracker processor allows for continuous tracking of one of more objects
  over a finite sequence of video frames. It must be used downstream of an
  object detector extension node, thus allowing for the extension to be
  configured to to perform inferences on sparse frames through the use of the
  'maximumSamplesPerSecond' sampling property. The object tracker node will then
  track the detected objects over the frames in which the detector is not
  invoked resulting on a smother tracking of detected objects across the
  continuum of video frames. The tracker will stop tracking objects which are
  not subsequently detected by the upstream detector on the subsequent
  detections.

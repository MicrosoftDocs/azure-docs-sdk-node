      Orientation of the text recognized in the image, if requested. The value
      (up, down, left, or

      right) refers to the direction that the top of the recognized text is
      facing, after the image

      has been rotated around its center according to the detected text angle
      (see textAngle

      property).

      If detection of the orientation was not requested, or no text is detected,
      the value is

      'NotDetected'.

      The angle, in radians, of the detected text with respect to the closest
      horizontal or vertical

      direction. After rotating the input image clockwise by this angle, the
      recognized text lines

      become horizontal or vertical. In combination with the orientation
      property it can be used to

      overlay recognition results correctly on the original image, by rotating
      either the original

      image or recognition results by a suitable angle around the center of the
      original image. If

      the angle cannot be confidently detected, this property is not present. If
      the image contains

      text at different angles, only part of the text will be recognized
      correctly.

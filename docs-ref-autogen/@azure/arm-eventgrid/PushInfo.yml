    summary: >-
      Time span duration in ISO 8601 format that determines how long messages
      are available to the subscription from the time the message was published.

      This duration value is expressed using the following format:
      \'P(n)Y(n)M(n)DT(n)H(n)M(n)S\', where:
          - (n) is replaced by the value of each time element that follows the (n).
          - P is the duration (or Period) designator and is always placed at the beginning of the duration.
          - Y is the year designator, and it follows the value for the number of years.
          - M is the month designator, and it follows the value for the number of months.
          - W is the week designator, and it follows the value for the number of weeks.
          - D is the day designator, and it follows the value for the number of days.
          - T is the time designator, and it precedes the time components.
          - H is the hour designator, and it follows the value for the number of hours.
          - M is the minute designator, and it follows the value for the number of minutes.
          - S is the second designator, and it follows the value for the number of seconds.
      This duration value cannot be set greater than the topic’s
      EventRetentionInDays. It is is an optional field where its minimum value
      is 1 minute, and its maximum is determined

      by topic’s EventRetentionInDays value. The followings are examples of
      valid values:
          - \'P0DT23H12M\' or \'PT23H12M\': for duration of 23 hours and 12 minutes.
          - \'P1D\' or \'P1DT0H0M0S\': for duration of 1 day.

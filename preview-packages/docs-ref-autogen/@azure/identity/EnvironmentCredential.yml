### YamlMime:TSType
name: EnvironmentCredential
uid: '@azure/identity.EnvironmentCredential'
package: '@azure/identity'
summary: >
  Enables authentication to Azure Active Directory using client secret

  details configured in the following environment variables:

  Required environment variables:

  - `AZURE_TENANT_ID`: The Azure Active Directory tenant (directory) ID.

  - `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`: The client (application) ID of an App Registration in the
  tenant.


  Environment variables used for client credential authentication:

  - `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`: A client secret that was generated for the App
  Registration.

  - `AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PATH`: The path to a PEM certificate to use during
  the authentication, instead of the client secret.


  Alternatively, users can provide environment variables for username and
  password authentication:

  - `AZURE_USERNAME`: Username to authenticate with.

  - `AZURE_PASSWORD`: Password to authenticate with.


  This credential ultimately uses a <xref:ClientSecretCredential> to

  perform the authentication using these details.  Please consult the

  documentation of that class for more details.

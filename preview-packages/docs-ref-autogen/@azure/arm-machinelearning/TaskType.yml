  Defines values for TaskType. \

  [KnownTaskType](xref:@azure/arm-machinelearning.KnownTaskType) can be used
  interchangeably with TaskType,
   this enum contains the known values that the service supports.
  ### Known values supported by the service

  **Classification**: Classification in machine learning and statistics is a
  supervised learning approach in which

  the computer program learns from the data given to it and make new
  observations or classifications. \

  **Regression**: Regression means to predict the value using the input data.
  Regression models are used to predict a continuous value. \

  **Forecasting**: Forecasting is a special kind of regression task that deals
  with time-series data and creates forecasting model

  that can be used to predict the near future values based on the inputs. \

  **ImageClassification**: Image Classification. Multi-class image
  classification is used when an image is classified with only a single label

  from a set of classes - e.g. each image is classified as either an image of a
  'cat' or a 'dog' or a 'duck'. \

  **ImageClassificationMultilabel**: Image Classification Multilabel.
  Multi-label image classification is used when an image could have one or more
  labels

  from a set of labels - e.g. an image could be labeled with both 'cat' and
  'dog'. \

  **ImageObjectDetection**: Image Object Detection. Object detection is used to
  identify objects in an image and locate each object with a

  bounding box e.g. locate all dogs and cats in an image and draw a bounding box
  around each. \

  **ImageInstanceSegmentation**: Image Instance Segmentation. Instance
  segmentation is used to identify objects in an image at the pixel level,

  drawing a polygon around each object in the image. \

  **TextClassification**: Text classification (also known as text tagging or
  text categorization) is the process of sorting texts into categories.

  Categories are mutually exclusive. \

  **TextClassificationMultilabel**: Multilabel classification task assigns each
  sample to a group (zero or more) of target labels. \

  **TextNER**: Text Named Entity Recognition a.k.a. TextNER.

  Named Entity Recognition (NER) is the ability to take free-form text and
  identify the occurrences of entities such as people, locations, organizations,
  and more.

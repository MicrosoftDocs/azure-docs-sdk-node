      The URL of the container within Azure Blob Storage to which to upload the
      Batch Service log file(s). If a user assigned managed identity is not
      being used, the URL must include a Shared Access Signature (SAS) granting
      write permissions to the container. The SAS duration must allow enough
      time for the upload to finish. The start time for SAS is optional and
      recommended to not be specified.

      The end of the time range from which to upload Batch Service log file(s).
      Any log file containing a log message in the time range will be uploaded.
      This means that the operation might retrieve more logs than have been
      requested since the entire log file is always uploaded, but the operation
      should not retrieve fewer logs than have been requested. If omitted, the
      default is to upload all logs available after the startTime.

Bing often flights new\rfeatures and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning\rtraffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a\ruser across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user to multiple\rconflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead\rto an inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second request has a\rdifferent flight assignment than the first, the experience may be\runexpected.

If you do not include this header in the request, Bing\rgenerates an ID and returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The\ronly time that you should NOT include this header in a request is the first\rtime the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing\rAPI request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the\rclient ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie\rto ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie.\rFor other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to\rpersist the ID. The next time the user uses your app on that device, get the\rclient ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this\rheader.

Typical values might be 22m\rfor GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP\rlookup. ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the\rlocation.

Persisting the client ID across\rmultiple requests for the same end user and device combination enables 1)\rthe API consumer to receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher\rclick-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each\ruser that uses your application on the device must have a unique, Bing\rgenerated client ID. If you do not include this header in the request, Bing\rgenerates an ID and returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The\ronly time that you should NOT include this header in a request is the first\rtime the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing\rAPI request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the\rclient ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie\rto ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie.\rFor other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to\rpersist the ID. The next time the user uses your app on that device, get the\rclient ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this\rheader. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use\rit for all subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If you\rinclude the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request."
